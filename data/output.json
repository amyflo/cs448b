I didn\\u2019t expect that you felt this way, that you saw me as I see you, and knowing this changes so much in my heart. It\\u2019s comforting, but also bittersweet, to understand that what I felt wasn\\u2019t one-sided, that those moments we shared held a quiet but powerful meaning for both of us.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t want to keep avoiding this, hiding the connection we both feel so deeply. Maybe you\\u2019re right - acknowledging these feelings doesn\\u2019t have to mean crossing lines or risking harm. Perhaps it could help us both find peace, help us understand what we share without the unspoken tension lingering between us. I don\\u2019t want to be left wondering about what we could say to each other, or what we could learn from one another by being honest and gentle with the truth.\\n\\nI see now that we\\u2019ve both been trying to do the right thing, even if it\\u2019s meant keeping a distance that feels unnatural. I don\\u2019t want to keep hurting you by pulling back, and I don\\u2019t want you to feel like a burden or a \\u201ccreep\\u201d because of something that is simply honest and real. You\\u2019re not a burden to me, and I\\u2019m sorry if my actions have ever made you feel that way.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re open to it, let\\u2019s have that conversation. Let\\u2019s be honest about the feelings we\\u2019ve both kept inside for too long. I know we\\u2019ve both tried to respect the boundaries we have, and I think we can keep doing that, even with a little more openness. Thank you for sharing this, for being brave enough to let me know how you feel. You\\u2019ve given me so much to think about, and I\\u2019d love the chance to talk more, to understand this and each other fully.\\n\\nNo matter what, please know that you have changed my life too, and I care about you deeply.\\n\\nYour letter truly spoke to me, I\\u2019ll message you in the am, help me please \\ud83d\\ude4f\\ud83c\\udffb\",\n                    \"parentID\": \"t3_1gmt29o\",\n                    \"commentId\": \"t1_lw74c94\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1gmt29o/i_would_tell_you_the_truth_if_i_didnt_think_it/lw74c94/\",\n                    \"username\": \"RFPW\",\n                    \"createdAt\": \"2024-11-09T03:44:19.000Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"body\": \"I just binge read your posts!

We went to different colleges, hundreds of miles from one another. Her in another state, me closer to home. I was too dumb to realize every holiday break she had she came home and contacted me for a reason. She was just hoping, praying, that I would say the very words I was scared to say. Not to mention she herself was just as scared still.\\n\\nShortly into college, we both ended up with other people, and life went on. Months, sometimes years, went by without us talking to one another, and then we would for a few days. Nothing flirtatious, just genuine friendship, and then we wouldn't talk again. This has been our cycle for the last 18 years, and the entire time we neither one ever stopped wondering how the other was doing. If they were okay. If they were happy.\\n\\nAfter we reconnected this last time, she told me, \\\"I had to keep you at arms length, because if I didn't I knew I'd have to admit I never stopped loving you.\\\"\\n\\nWe reconnected because both of us were having a hard time in our marriages. We just started talking one night and it snowballed from there.

Wouldn't put it past her.\\n\\nEspecially since I'm 100% certain everybody involved (whoever else that hasn't already abandoned her, that is) is being lied to from all angles by her. Because that's how she operates. Triangulating everybody against everybody else. Making us enemies when in reality we should be friends lmao. We need to start a support group until she gets the help she needs (the help would be a heroic dose of me, btw \\ud83d\\ude0f). \\n\\nIn any case, everything I wrote is just the truth and she could learn from it but she'd rather be arrogant and pretend she's something she's not because she has to \\\"win\\\" this posturing contest between her and I.

Ones refusal to grow up because they were spoiled and one not knowing because they were never taught as a child. Then there is the insecure who don't know themselves and are still learning, but are scared to be proven wrong or being seen that they DO NOT know something, they want to bring the other down so they feel superior. They just don't know how to do it right. \\n   It's ok to NOT KNOW SOMETHING IF YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TAUGHT. Wow! I straight went to how that related to my life and dissected the hell out of it. Lol Either way though, you break it down, you can relate it to your life, only if you have the humility and patience to see ones struggles and truly care for them, you will fight to show them that.

U say that i am all uve ever wanted, that its u and me against the world! U just said that line to me this afternoon.  U claim im delusional &amp; blame me for tearing our family apart by accusing u of being with someone else. \\nI even blamed myself if u would have slept With someone else. I know that I'm not the 1st person in the world that has ever went through a period of having a low Sex drive at some point or another we've been together for 20 years. I'm sorry that it happened but it Did happen and I blamed myself and I was willing to forgive you if you did sleep with someone else.. When I was going through Those 2 years of getting sober and putting my life together my sex drive went down and I pushed you away and it is the worst Mistake I ever made. But then you come Back home. You were working with me to put our lives back together. We were getting along so well great actually. I loved sex again. You said that you loved having me back that you missed me. You know I consider you the love of my life and then I get on here and I see all the stuff that I swear I really think it's you and you're telling this other person that you're leaving me going with them. This is all so confusing that it is ripping me Apart so bad that I can't breathe. My world, our boys world is falling apart and there's nothing I can do about it but cry and scream which does nothing but push you further away. It's like you're punishing me and playing games. But you will not communicate at all and tell me what's going on. I've become a basket case around the kids And this is the last thing they need they need stability they just got stability. How selfish can we be? You should have never come back home if you were wanting someone else. This hurts so So bad I just want it to end. Oh. These? Replies say how they wish the best for you guys that they hope you guys work it. Out get? Together. What about me...what about our boys... you're selfish you're so fucking selfish.

But of course being man I feel in a different frequency than women it's true, (I say this because all guys say say I'm a emotional female type. Nope I just get how our differences work.) however that being said there is a reason so many misread me. I truly believe it's because they seek knowledge of who I am from others am I this unapproachable or scary. So right off I feel a little bit what?... Not quite normal but when I am forced to feel pain in so powerful a volume because I am left out the loop in tears my heart and leaves broken. Everyone ask for open page like truth I give but somehow because I do not demand it I'm not taken seriously until I say okay I must go this is to unhealthy. Then I'm a giant monster who just plays games and hates women. Well it likely should be in most people eyes but nothing is further from the truth. Now I am lost to all it feels like I can not make that first move. Getting hurt or even worst hurting another it has me really terrified me and this is what happens to me now when I feel to slightest connection. I get drawn in so fast and its perfect if they remain unavailable I am perfect suto relationship and only I'm aware but if they start giving me openings I'd bit right?! Wrong I shut down go cold and this is not an old defect in few years I have been in a very complicated situation that now has it a level of unbelievably! Dangerous she has turned off any worthwhile emotions and is resigned to death. I am more than just a little pissed off here because even if we are not likely ever going to be together I still imagine how amazing it might have been and if we'd would have lasted, sadly I'm at the place that is yes we would have become married lived our lives why? Well it's the powerful way in which so many worked so hard to keep this from ever happening even any other interests were outright crushed to show a pattern now this is my best guess as I have only thereoy to  give my broken damaged untold why heart anything at all. So remember relationships are always two way streets and those whom think they are one way traffic only to there needs are already the losers.\",\n                    \"parentID\": \"t3_123o5kt\",\n                    \"commentId\": \"t1_jdwpibl\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/123o5kt/femine_and_divine/jdwpibl/\",\n                    \"username\": \"NoMall139\",\n                    \"createdAt\": \"2023-03-27T19:16:49.000Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"body\": \"My fav too.\",\n                    \"parentID\": \"t3_1227hny\",\n                    \"commentId\": \"t1_jdp3q3o\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1227hny/my_morning_scribble/jdp3q3o/\",\n                    \"username\": \"SafeComfortable1009\",\n                    \"createdAt\": \"2023-03-26T02:00:21.000Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"body\": \"Thankyou...\",\n                    \"parentID\": \"t3_124fyyw\",\n                    \"commentId\": \"t1_je1nlve\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/124fyyw/muse/je1nlve/\",\n                    \"username\": \"YouDisasterous7982\",\n                    \"createdAt\": \"2023-03-28T19:34:51.000Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"body\": \"Rendered re-write responnce: I dare you, nay I straight up as one super frustrated male with woman gasping for breath fighting in a war of desire holding back the flood of I love you!

At the very least it lets me know that I did love once.\",\n                    \"parentID\": \"t3_10j6x28\",\n                    \"commentId\": \"t1_j5m4puu\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/10j6x28/wonderwall/j5m4puu/\",\n                    \"username\": \"StayChoked\",\n                    \"createdAt\": \"2023-01-23T23:48:23.000Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"body\": \"Was that special number 40\\ud83d\\ude44\",\n                    \"parentID\": \"t3_109lhdp\",\n                    \"commentId\": \"t1_jf5i6bm\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/109lhdp/i_know_i_fucked_everything_up/jf5i6bm/\",\n                    \"username\": \"[deleted]\",\n                    \"createdAt\": \"2023-04-06T05:40:31.000Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"body\": \"[deleted]\",\n                    \"parentID\": \"t3_1082k52\",\n                    \"commentId\": \"t1_j3pz1hk\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1082k52/feedback_wanted_on_my_love_letter/j3pz1hk/\",\n                    \"username\": \"[deleted]\",\n                    \"createdAt\": \"2023-01-10T06:59:42.000Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"body\": \"Kayla ?\",\n                    \"parentID\": \"t3_1090oeo\",\n                    \"commentId\": \"t1_j407cwv\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1090oeo/the_endless_abyss_go_away/j407cwv/\",\n                    \"username\": \"teasagee1\",\n                    \"createdAt\": \"2023-01-12T06:54:25.000Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"body\": \"[deleted]\",\n                    \"parentID\": \"t3_108q5uw\",\n                    \"commentId\": \"t1_j6j3jac\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/108q5uw/how_do_i_tell_you/j6j3jac/\",\n                    \"username\": \"[deleted]\",\n                    \"createdAt\": \"2023-01-30T18:19:27.000Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"body\": \"No\",\n                    \"parentID\": \"t3_109lhdp\",\n                    \"commentId\": \"t1_jf5i7ot\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/109lhdp/i_know_i_fucked_everything_up/jf5i7ot/\",\n                    \"username\": \"teasagee1\",\n                    \"createdAt\": \"2023-04-06T05:40:58.000Z\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"body\": \"I misspelled word but hot!

His sister's wedding is this weekend, he also recently got suspended from college, and his old job won't take him back as full time so he's searching for a new opportunity. The break up just added more pressure onto him. He probably doesn't have time to think or process any of his emotions. I was advised to give him space. If he can sort through all the chaos he'll probably start opening up to people and talk about our break up. Of course holding onto that hope may prove harmful to me especially because time can also mean he'll find feelings for someone new. I don't want to let him go, but if it means he'll hurt a little less then maybe that's the right decision. If he believes in our love the same way I do then he'll find his way back. Until then I want follow my passions. Maybe get back into writing. I want to build a life I'm content with so if he decides to love someone else, I can feel satisficed with what I have and just wish him well. I appreciate your advice and support.

You respect her choice, but you still love her. She left and you hope she's still taking her vitamins. She really is missing out! You seem like such a caring guy and it sucks that this happened. Love can make you so happy and so depressed, joyful then angry, compromising then fighting. It's such a weird emotion and it's drastic. It fucking hurts like hell when someone just vanishes out of your life. Love is great for having children, love is great when having a pet, love is great for family. Love is a balance beam leaning right to left to stay stable. When you fall in love knowing that person can one day leave and act like you meant nothing, is beyond one word. I would compare it to grief, except when you grieve the person is dead. When that person is still alive and just vanishes that is beyond grief. I'm so sorry, I hope you find someone that loves you even more than you love her.

You are so unlike any breakup I\\u2019ve had before. You are my best friend, best lover, and most like home I\\u2019ve ever felt in my life. \\n\\nTo this day, I love you more and more, unconditionally, and eternally. Back When we made love, I saw vibrant rainbow colors wrapping us in pure cosmic love.  I remember adoring you and thanking the universe for the gift of you, admiring every perfect cell in your body. I gave all of my heart to you, and betraying that oath to you still feels like a betrayal to my heart. Your profound beauty and connection planted the seeds for my belief in god and something greater. \\n\\nThen god took me from you and put me here, absolutely crying my eyes out over a year later, still thinking about you in incredible frequency. There was no easy move-on from you. I don\\u2019t think I ever will move on. \\n\\nIn the darkest moments, I defeatedy prostrate myself on the floor, tears streaming down my face, and plead out with all my heart to the sky: \\u201cplease let him be ok, happy, and healthy.\\u201d\\n\\nAfterwards I always wish that you knew my real heart, without any of the fear or pain. I wish you knew me without the mismanaged, copeless trauma attached to me. \\n\\nI am a woman of self-doubt, self-criticism, self-punishment. But I know from all this:\\nmy feelings for you were real all along. The entanglement of anxiety that kept me from stoic, forward pursuit for our relationship was my life\\u2019s ultimate mistake. I am soooo worthy of your love. I never once doubted your worth.  \\nI have a golden heart, that is incredibly faithful. I\\u2019m glad to have respected and cherished what this relationship meant to me. I\\u2019m glad I refrained from using anger to deny any of it. \\nI am not my trauma. The way I acted is not who I am. It\\u2019s not even who I was. It felt like a glitch my body/mind. I\\u2019ve wrestled over and over about the presence of anger in my life at this brief stage. I recall being  in shock and horror for the things I said. None of that aligned with any part of my true heart. My body/mind\\u2019s trauma is not my true souls intent. \\n\\nThis leads me to my next point. \\n\\nWhile my healing wasn\\u2019t streamlined, it\\u2019s finally clicking. For one, I seriously had to grieve the loss of my former self. I had to grieve my damaged innocence, my lost years of succumbing to the drink to cope. Grief is surprisingly the biggest hallmark I notice in real change, whether I like it or not. It was hard to walk away from the identity of a victim. It comforted me for so long and let me stay in fear. The delusion of being sad all the time was my way of protecting myself from another hurt. My body thought it was saving me from more trauma. It only attracted more to me.  \\n\\nBattling addiction has come to a crest in this past year. No one was around to stop me but myself. I had no one to rely on and no one to be relied upon. I\\u2019m proud to say I continued to take on this moral duty. Months of sobriety were toggled with weeklong benders when the loneliness became too much to bear. \\n\\nI\\u2019m proud to say I\\u2019m almost 2 months sober and 100% figured it out. I\\u2019m not going back. I grieved the party and alcohol parts of me. I\\u2019m actually ok giving it up forever without the slightest hint of nostalgia/curiosity. It\\u2019s finally over. \\n\\nI\\u2019m grateful to know addiction. Now, eating healthy and going to the gym feel like easy-mode tasks compared to chemical dependency. I swear to god, it sounds so stupid, but I didn\\u2019t realize I could switch my mind that easily when I was in the grip of addiction. \\n\\nAnyway, my mind feels vastly different after consistent sobriety practice and major, major meditation commitment. I\\u2019m not bullshitting when I say I am religious in my practice. I meditate at least 30 min a day. \\n\\nMeditation has brought me the value of equanimity, and truly knowing who I am. It\\u2019s a little jarring, but nothing phases me anymore. Car accident? \\u201cHey stranger, I hope you\\u2019re ok.\\u201d Potential layoff? \\u201cOk, I\\u2019m super able and will find a job quickly.\\u201d Anxiety sparks up? \\u201cI notice you anxiety, you\\u2019re part of a story I tell myself to try to keep me safe. I appreciate it, but it\\u2019s not serving me in this very moment.\\u201d Election sucked? \\u201cWell, collectively our country will have a wake up call from this, even if it\\u2019s decades from now. I\\u2019m grateful for god\\u2019s plan\\u201d\\n\\nThrough meditation, I\\u2019m completely reprogramming myself. Take what I love, leave the rest behind. \\n\\nThe past I\\u2019ll leave beind. I forgive you for everything. I don\\u2019t even think about it unless it\\u2019s something that brings the most heartfelt smile. I thank you for everything you\\u2019ve given me. You woke up my soul to true love. You sparked my spiritual journey that I still am on. \\n\\nI was so complacent before that only a love this deep could have woke me up to do my soul\\u2019s life work. Yes, it all sounds so hippie dippie. It is. I\\u2019m actually sober sober too. No weed, nothing. The cosmic high I get through meditation is better than any drug or combination of drug on the planet. \\n\\nOhhh how I still yearn to be with you. But I\\u2019m actually different. I wonder what you\\u2019d think of me now. At the same time, I have an incredible distance to cover in my spiritual growth still. It will be a lifelong pursuit. My spiritual journey is all I care about in life now. I stopped dating a while ago. I stopped operating on a lot of inherent programming and now I am consciously mapping love into all that I can. \\n\\nI\\u2019m unapologetically being me. And I love me. I\\u2019m such a good person and a beautiful soul. None of that nonsense during the pandemic was me other than my love for you. I\\u2019m here to give and grow love, compassion. I still pray for your happiness every day, whatever that may mean for you. \\n\\nI wish you could know me now. I wish I could love you with this powerful energy I\\u2019ve found. I wish we could just talk and hug. I miss my best friend and I wish I could share the discoveries I\\u2019ve made. I wish I could see the magnitude of conscious love I can give without all the dumb unconscious stuff in the way. I wish I could hear about your adventures! I wish I could be there to help you grow in your life journey. \\n\\nI love you with all my heart. I absolutely friggin adore you.

things. my love for pomegranates, the seeds and juice. you always buy them when you see them, much to my delight. they are the perfect combination of freshness and sweetness, with a sour that ties it all together. you lovingly gaze at me as my fingers curl around the seeds when i\\u2019m too ravenous for a spoon. you often say i remind you of a pomegranate, difficult to open up, but if you do so gently and carefully, i yield fruit. my love for pomegranates was one of the first things you knew about me, and is something you always remember when i have my bad days, and my good days. \\n\\nyou know my love of writing, my love of expression through words. pen on paper, you write me all kinds of love letters, leaving them in spaces i wouldn\\u2019t think to look. sometimes they\\u2019re in the mailbox, other times in my current bookshelf, and in my textbooks for school. other times you put them high up where you know i can\\u2019t reach. you leave them in my lunch boxes that you carefully pack, my gym bag, and under my pillow while i sleep. i love reading them over and over again and gently sliding my hands across the papers to feel your indentations. you also share my love

your hands through my hair, lightly scratching my scalp. it helps with the migraines from reading reports and writing them all day long. it makes my brow relax and allows me to sink into you, the

They were f/m besties of 10 years and claimed to only be platonic (no one believed it tho). Anyways,  my dad was always super tough on me and my sister but let the boys run wild. Anywho, this boy finally got to take me on my 1st date when I 15 almost 16. He was so nerdy and shy..I liked that about him.  I only had 1 boyfriend before that but he was a total tool. We go eat then went to a party. Well even tho we're not dating as its a first date, and 2nd time meeting eachother, I expected a little bit of commitment to me for the night.  But, nope. He got drunk (he was 17) and literally had a bj contest in the front yard of this house party. 4 nasty girls sucking him off for clout. I walked up and seen what was happening, but virgin innocent me didn't understand. I called my sister to pick me up. Fast forward a few months after zero contact(before social media) and he hits me up out of the blue asking to hang out. He has no appearent memory of what happened 11 months prior. Again, I'm young and nieve. So I let him take me out again. By now I'm 17 and him 19. We got out to a movie and end up at his place (his parents house). We had a few beers followed by passionate sex in the shower and agian in his parents bed. My 1st (and 2nd) time. He had no idea it was my 1st time...he never asked. It just happened so fast. We hooked up a few more times after that and dated a while. Well, I move and lost all contact with this boy, now man. Fast forawd 15 years. \\nHe hits me up on Facebook out of the blue. Apparently he took off to the military shortly after we last hooked up and I had a pregnancy scare. He was by this time un happily married and being a single dad. His wife was also in the military but was cheating on him openly whwhile staying fone because she didnt want to be a mom. Somehow they had another baby together 4 years later. 2 years later I  flew out to him where he was stationed and spent the week with him and his kids (babies)while his wife was away cheating.  We hooked up all week, then I flew home. I seriously had the best time with him seeing the ocean,  watching football and just being together.  It felt like in that moment,  i was meant to be there. He made me feel like i was on top of the world, protcted and wanted. \\nAgain we lost contact as he was trying to save his failed marriage, even though now, technically he had an affair as well. Me being the bigger person and wanting to protect him from getting caught, i cut all contact. This killed me because time and time again the universe worked to re kindle us. Anyways, so I'm home a couple years and you guessed it...he reached out. By this time I was married with 2 babies so I told him no. He left me alone a couple more  years.\\n He reaches out agian. By now me and hubby have drifted apart and called it quits while still staying co habitents...beacuse who can afford to be a single parent making $14 an hour...no one.  So Anyways, he says his wife and him are done as well. We take a wonderful vacation together doing the best thing ever(ask me in the comments and I'll tell ya..no not sex, even tho yes there was a tons of that too).  It's time to part ways again as he was still living with his estranged wife in another state. \\nWell, he moves to my neighborhood 4 months later!!! We start a relationship and over a few months I realize he is definitely not the boy I've loved all this time. He changed. He is whiny and selfish.\\n So,  I go out of state to see family for the holiday... as we both had very different living arrangements due to x's and kids and whatnot it was hard to link up sometimes even though we were literally 3 minutes apart. Our children have become great friends and so now their happiness is all that matters. Anyways the whole time that I'm with my parents out of state he is blowing me up asking me why I'm not talking to him why I'm not FaceTiming him why I'm not giving him attention and it's literally the holiday and I'm with my family. He was being a prick before i left too to travel, or I would have invited him as well because my family knows him.\\n And it gets better, after talking and rekindling, it was mentioned in conversation that not only did we start dating in high school when we were young teenagers, but we were also neighbors almost our entire lives and did not know until he told me this when I was 37 years old. This boy now man has literally been in my life (whether I knew it or not) for the past 32 of my 38 years on this planet. \\nSo back to the holiday thing, when I came back things were just really Rocky and I can tell the shift in him and the change that made me not like him anymore. It was nothing in particular that he did or said, it was just the overall aspect of everything. So obviously we lost contact again even though he lives down the street. A few months after our un-agreed upon separation, he starts dating another person. Not only is he dating the other person but he's rubbing it in my face. And the person he is dating is old enough to be his mother. So now that he has a new girlfriend, I'm not allowed to text him anymore and our children are no longer allowed to have play dates anymore because I'm too much of a threat to her. I would think by this point me and the boy in question would at least be best friends and he would tell his girlfriend that I'm not going anywhere. (even though things are rocky)\\n Well now let's fast forward even a little bit more to recent. So now that his family has met his older girlfriend person, he has started letting his daughter come back around my daughter and of course they gossip so I hear everything. Apparently they are pretty serious and he lied to me. A few weeks ago he got into my DMs asking for sex. He has always told me for 20 years now that I was the best sex he ever had.. but if that were true why did he leave so many times? He is only dating his girlfriend to get back at me for not giving him an 18th chance. \\nWell one night I was drinking and he sled into my Dms telling me that him and his girlfriend weren't serious and that he wasn't really happy. Of course I ended up in his bed.. five times. Now he has cheated on his new girlfriend 5 times. We would still be seeing each other if I didn't break it off after seeing photos of them on social media happily together at concerts and whatnot. Pretty much looking back I dodged a bullet because this man is obviously a player and has the heart of mud. The way this boy has dragged me through the mud over the last 28 years of my life and has given me false hope and has left me on to believe that one day we would be together like it was meant to be. I know they say that if you can be the bigger person and pretend like you're happy, that's the best way to get back at somebody... but I'm at the point now where I can't even pretend to be happy. Not that I would ever date him because I know he's a player, but, part of me just feels like I lost a best friend I didn't know I had. Like a part of me died. And I have told him this and his only response is\\\" oh\\\" .\\n He never loved me the way I have loved him. I'll never know what could have been. Now he says that he still loves me,  he wants to have sex with me all the time and that he can see us being married one day and that I was his long lost love.  I guess men will say whatever they have to say to get back in pants.  I'm not the one that got away, he's the one that I left. So now I'm torn on whether I should still be his friend even though he hasn't always been the best of a friend to me....or if I should let his girlfriend know that he cheated....... And if it wasn't for me breaking it off, he would still be cheating on her with me. I finally discovered my worth and I will never ever have interaction with this man again. I got the boy, and she got the boy just 20 years older. I'm so tired I don't know what to do. I feel like I lost my best friend. Talking to him won't help. Same broken tune. Also,  I would never date him again after knowing what I know. And also his girlfriend needs to know. His child and my child are best friends so we do see each other like every other week and sometimes his girlfriend is with them and sometimes she is not. I have never introduced myself as it is awkward as f*** obviously. I don't know what to do. Part of me just wants to get my kids and run away start over with new people.. but part of me knows that I can never leave.  I'm still waiting for him to choose me. The only thing really keeping me from telling his girlfriend about us is the fact that if I do he will not let his daughter visit with my daughter anymore and that would only hurt my daughter and his.   I feel used. Why coukdnt he chose me? I always waited for him....the second he is in my life again, he runs itbin my face that i cantvhave him.Help.\\n\\nAlso..I left breadcrumbs at his home to alert his girlfriend that I'm was there...sadly she never found them...he did and he is mad at me. I feel so guilty and like I'm working on eggshells but I'm not the one doing anything wrong.

You know the story, but I love telling it anyway.\\n\\nHigh school, senior year. We had only just met a couple of months ago, and you invited me to your house to hang out on Halloween. We were supposed to watch scary movies all night with a small group of friends. I remember showing up and you got into the alcohol. You always were, and still are, a lightweight, and so damned adorable when you were tipsy.\\n\\nI remember you grabbed a bottle and couldn't remember if it was screw top or pop off. You decided to try and use a bottle opener anyway. I remember seeing your pouty face when a shard of glass went into your drink. I laughed and said, \\\"Just clinch your teeth when you drink! You'll be fine!\\\" and your pout grew five times stronger.\\n\\nIt was at that moment I realized, as I gazed at your sad eyes and your stuck out bottom lip, that I was in trouble. I took the bottle from you and quickly opened up a new one to give to you. There is, even to this day, nothing I can do to stop the power of your pout.\\n\\nWe went out to rent some movies, and I had to have my arms around you the whole time to keep you steady. The last thing I wanted was to have you arrested for public intox and underage drinking. We walked around the store looking at horror movies to rent, my hands never leaving your side. It seems I have always wanted to make sure you are safe.\\n\\nWhen we got back to your house, somebody in the group decided we should play hide n seek. Naturally, I stayed with you. I didn't go through all the trouble of leading you around the rental store only to let you get injured in your own house by stumbling around in the dark! \\n\\nWe hid in the bathroom at one point. You stumbled, and I caught you, only this time to catch you, my arms had to wrap around your midsection, and I had to pull you close to me to keep you from falling. Our eyes met, and I could feel electricity in the air. I knew you had a boyfriend, and I had a girlfriend, but they were both long distance and, to be perfectly blunt, barely mattered in that moment. I wasn't sure if you felt the same though, so I pulled away. You huffed, clenched your fists, stomped your feet, and exclaimed, \\\"Well, are you gonna kiss me or not?!\\\"\\n\\nIt was the pouty face again, and this time with words giving me the greenlight. I. was. fucked.\\n\\nMy arms went back around you, and I pulled you into me. Our lips crushed against each other, leaving not a single crack or crevice for light to shine through. In that moment, everything felt perfect. We fell together like two puzzle pieces, perfectly natural, as if we had been dating our entire lives.\\n\\nOf course, we spent most of the rest of the night hiding from everyone else and kissing in the darkness. Despite barely being able to see one another in a near pitch black house, our lips never had any trouble finding one another. It was as if they were drawn to each other, made for one another and no one else.\\n\\nLater on, we did put in a couple of the movies, but I can't remember actually watching them. I was too transfixed on you. I only remember hearing the music in your voice when you would laugh, and feeling you wrap your arms around mine and hiding your face in my chest when you were scared.\\n\\nWhen the movies were over, you stood up, and said you needed to go to bed, but you were too scared to walk to your room alone. I'm no fool, I knew you weren't, and I definitely wasn't about to let anyone else volunteer to walk with you. \\n\\nI stood up from the couch and walked with you. When we got to your room we kissed, and you said you had to change for bed. You asked me to not close the door because it was scary. Naturally, I turned my back to give you your privacy and to look down the hallway, making sure nobody else came by and saw anything. You told me to turn back around, and with a smile you said you were still scared, and asked if I would stay with you until you fell asleep.\\n\\nThe pouty face again. No turning back now.\\n\\nI laid with you, and we talked for awhile, and ck tiniest to kiss, as well as other things that I will not write here. Suffice to say, we spent a beautiful time together. You fell asleep in my arms as we spooned. I was out soon after.\\n\\nIn the middle of the night, I woke up, not even realizing I had fallen asleep. I was scared. How long has I been in here? Has anyone noticed I've been gone so long? What if it gets back to your boyfriend? I couldn't risk messing up your relationship, because I did not know how serious it was or wasn't, not how serious we were or weren't.\\n\\nI slipped my arm out from underneath you, and climbed out of the bed quietly, so as to not wake you. I went back to the living room to find most of the group had left, and hung out with my best friend before we crashed on the pullout bed in the living room.\\n\\nThe next morning, you came into the living room and said \\\"Good morning boys.\\\" You stretched and then suddenly clutches your chest and exclaimed, \\\"OHMYGOD! I'M NOT WEARING A BRA!\\\"\\n\\nWe erupted into fits of laughter as you left the room. Shouting to you that it's okay, nobody could see anything. I think you left so fast, and so mortified, that you didn't even hear us.\\n\\nOnce you were ready, I drove you to your performance. Choir or drama, regionals or something like that. After you left, I dropped my friend off at his house and went right back to the school, on a Saturday no less! I picked you up, and we hung out the rest of the day. It was as if nobody else in the world mattered. We would kiss, drive around the little town we grew up in, talking about anything and everything. \\n\\nWe talked about your future, and what you wanted to do for a career. I can never express enough to you how proud I am for you achieving it. Not only achieving, but excelling! I'm so proud of you Miss Nationally Recognized with Multiple Awards.\\n\\nI've rambled enough here. I guess, all of this is just my long winded way of saying that I miss you. I love that we had reconnected, but unfortunately we cannot speak right now. I understand, truly I do. Your life and your career I would never ask you to blow up just to be with me. You've worked too hard. I love you too much to let that happen. I wish I could send you this letter, but I am afraid it would only do more bad than good.\\n\\nI love you. I have loved you forever, and I always will. I know you feel the same. Don't you worry darling, I'll always be here for you, and I don't care if we're 65 when we finally get to be together for good. I'm going to marry you. In the meantime though, you keep being the amazing woman I know you are, and I'll keep working on myself, for me and for you.\\n\\nI love you J.

Clear as day I remember your every feature. I wish I could just forget you. Messaging you to meet was stupid Ik that now. And I was curious to see what your response would be,  subconsciously I already knew you would block me straight away. \\n\\nI wonder if you\\u2019ve been able to sleep anyone else since our split \\nI burned all the pictures of you yet the picture of you in my mind still remains..\\n\\nHow I wish I could tell you all the things that\\u2019s has happened in my life. All the insane things seem arbitrary when it comes to being so sad.

You will always have a piece of it a piece not even me or another love may grasp hold of again. \\n\\nI fear that I may never trust another person with my fragile heart I never want to experience that pain ever again I felt my heart being ripped out my chest strangers telling me I\\u2019m to pretty to cry. \\n\\nStrangers seeing that I was so deflated and broken the tears stung my eyes when I realised you wouldn\\u2019t meet them again. Not in reality not even within a phone screen. \\n\\nI loved you so much, so so much and I think you didn\\u2019t love me at all \\nI feel a hole in my soul like a piece of me has been ripped away. \\n\\nMy eyes are so glazed over I cannot see another as I did with you. I can not see beauty not without you. \\n\\nI miss your body, the way your peppermint smell would linger on my neck and lips. How I\\u2019d look into those big brown eyes and see nothing but pools of opportunity, love and of course chocolate my favourite part of you was those lips I kissed many others but no one could set me on fire like you. Compared to you they were sparks that went out as soon as my lips that met theirs. You made me cry happy cry when I first kissed you, I never experienced that in my life you set my soul on fire and you burned for me. Why couldn\\u2019t we go back to that. Forget everything that has happened. \\n\\n\\nYour the logical one and I\\u2019m the emotional one I keep fucking dreaming about you having pleasurable moments me asking when can I see you again and you fading away into dust as I slowly regain consciousness \\n\\nBut if you think of me, anything at all what do you think ?

Clear as day I remember your every feature. I wish I could just forget you. Messaging you to meet was stupid Ik that now. And I was curious to see what your response would be,  subconsciously I already knew you would block me straight away. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wonder if you\\u2019ve been able to sleep anyone else since our split \\nI burned all the pictures of you yet the picture of you in my mind still remains..&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How I wish I could tell you all the things that\\u2019s has happened in my life. All the insane things seem arbitrary when it comes to being so sad. Late at night I remember, not I but my body how you\\u2019d make me feel not just in pleasure but in my heart.. you made me feel alive now I\\u2019m just numb again &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;sleeping sleeping all the time sleep is my lover now &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I wonder how you walked away from me so easily how you could stand to not meet my lips and my soul again, we both did fucked up things either one we were willing to be taken with accountability &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I\\u2019m learning to learn to unlove you with ever fibre of me I fear my heart will never be the same. You will always have a piece of it a piece not even me or another love may grasp hold of again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I fear that I may never trust another person with my fragile heart I never want to experience that pain ever again I felt my heart being ripped out my chest strangers telling me I\\u2019m to pretty to cry. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Strangers seeing that I was so deflated and broken the tears stung my eyes when I realised you wouldn\\u2019t meet them again. Not in reality not even within a phone screen. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I loved you so much, so so much and I think you didn\\u2019t love me at all \\nI feel a hole in my soul like a piece of me has been ripped away. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My eyes are so glazed over I cannot see another as I did with you. I can not see beauty not without you. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I miss your body, the way your peppermint smell would linger on my neck and lips. How I\\u2019d look into those big brown eyes and see nothing but pools of opportunity, love and of course chocolate my favourite part of you was those lips I kissed many others but no one could set me on fire like you. Compared to you they were sparks that went out as soon as my lips that met theirs. You made me cry happy cry when I first kissed you, I never experienced that in my life you set my soul on fire and you burned for me. Why couldn\\u2019t we go back to that. Forget everything that has happened. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Your the logical one and I\\u2019m the emotional one I keep fucking dreaming about you having pleasurable moments me asking when can I see you again and you fading away into dust as I slowly regain consciousness &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But if you think of me, anything at all what do you think ? Do you dream at all do you remember the first night we kissed are you happier without me? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;are you content are you lonely ? Are you at all regretful are you in love with another are you alone right now are you in a dark room crying like I do ?

There\\u2019s not a day goes by where you don\\u2019t dominate my thoughts; I don\\u2019t see anyone else but your beautiful self. The sheer mention of your name makes my heart skip a beat and every time I see a picture of you, I fall in love all over again. I watch you making your Voice Acting videos; seeing you truly expressing your passion is beautiful and when you praise me about my work, it sends me to cloud nine. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I just wish that we weren\\u2019t divided by an ocean so that I could be with you and strive to make you the happiest woman in the world, as you deserve to be. Your everlasting beauty will never leave my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 3,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 0.81,\n            \"upVotes\": 9,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/13xng2k/i_wish_i_could_tell_you_how_perfect_you_are/\",\n            \"username\": \"DanielCollinsYT\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_13xr9xz\": {\n            \"title\": \"I dream about you.\",\n            \"body\": \"I always dream about you.

Wish I had one more time with you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I guess I\\u2019ll just keep torturing myself, I\\u2019ll keep destroying what\\u2019s inside, put everything back in the dark, lock the door and throw away the key.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Wish I had one more chance to hold you close and tell you I love you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Missing you.

I know I don't have the right, but I can't deal with this myself. I've tried. It's not fair to you. I know that. As I told your mother, I did this to myself, and it's mostly about Asperger's Syndrome. I never thought you owed me anything. Your contribution, such as it was, ended forty years ago and was completely innocent. You smiled at me in church, and, for the record, I smiled back. You had no way of knowing what would happen. Neither did I. I didn't even know it was happening until the depression hit.\\n\\nI'm here, because I want to tell you what I did, and I want you to respond as honestly as possible. That's it. It's not a scam; it's not a business deal. It's therapy. Nothing more. I don't expect anything from you. I am in pain, and I am frozen. My life has been on hold for six months, and I want it back. I can't do that unless I confront this part.\\n\\nWhat happened was weird and complicated, even for me. I won't be offended if you have doubts. I certainly did. But everything I'm going to tell you is true, as far as I know it. Some of it is speculation, but I'll point that out. Some of it will also be uncomfortable. I'm very sorry for that.\\n\\nFor the past six months, I've tried to keep this away from you. Part of me has. Part of me wanted to tell you everything. I've tried distracting that part of myself and tricking it and forcing it down, and it worked for a while. My therapist suggested reaching out to you for a neutral conversation. That's when I sent you the LinkedIn request, but I eventually knew that wouldn't work. Then, I asked my mother to go through the grapevine and ask about you. I wanted to trick myself into thinking I'd contacted you when I hadn't. That got me through March. In April, it started to break down.\\n\\nI was doing okay in February and March. I seemed to have leveled out. I thought that would be my new normal, just a low grade depression for the rest of my life. But that didn't happen.\\n\\nI had good days and bad. The worst was December. I lost entire days to it. I had trouble eating, trouble sleeping, trouble working. I probably lost five pounds. January was almost as bad. I punched a wall and broke a knuckle. In February and March, the good and bad days were about even. In April, I started getting worse. I had more bad days, and they were more severe. I saw the direction I was headed. I needed to diffuse it before it got really bad. That's when I decided I had to reach out to you. And I was right. May has been even worse. It's almost as bad as January.\\n\\nI promise, I won't contact you again after this. I'm going to hate myself a lot for what I'm doing. The guilt and the promise will keep me away. They've always been strong motivators for me. I don't need to worry about tricks and distractions anymore.\\n\\nThat's the first reason I contacted you. The second reason is to hear your response. I don't have any unreasonable expectations for that. You will answer honestly and in a way that best suits your life, whatever that happens to be. But, I need to hear it from you, because I can't move past this part. It hurts too much.\\n\\nI'll start with Asperger's Syndrome. What Asperger's does to me, specifically, damage to my fusiform gyrus prevents me from reading non-verbal communication, and my brain never receives the signal to release oxytocin in response, so I never form emotional connections.\\n\\nImagine you could lose the pain of everyone you've ever lost or everyone you've ever seen suffer, but you would also lose all the love and happiness that went with them. And, not just them. You would lose the closeness of everyone around you now. You wouldn't forget them; you just wouldn't feel anything for them.\\n\\nImagine feeling guilty if you try to tell your mother you love her, because you know it's a lie. You don't hate her, but you don't love her. You know it hurts her that she can't hear that from you, but it doesn't change anything.\\n\\nImagine knowing, when your parents die, you won't feel bad. You won't feel good. You won't feel. You know this absolutely, because it's happened with people you've already lost.\\n\\nImagine standing next to your grandmother's coffin and feeling cheated, because you can't participate in the grief of everyone around you. Imagine going to her funeral *hoping* to feel pain, because it would be *something*.\\n\\nImagine being attacked your whole life, because you \\\"don't want to feel.\\\" Imagine feeling alone in a room full of people when you're with your family. Imagine being on the outside of every group. Imagine being born into this, like being punished every day, but you don't know what you did wrong.\\n\\nFor thirty-six years, that was my life. When I learned I had Asperger's, I had an answer. I could stop feeling guilty at funerals. I was disappointed. I still wanted connection, but I understood the neurology. I was able to accept it, to come to terms with it. That was my mindset last November, before the depression began.\\n\\nHowever, it's important to understand that the release mechanism for oxytocin is damaged, not the processing mechanism. I know from pets, that if I can get oxytocin into my system some other way, in their case tactile interaction, that it will work.\\n\\nThis is where we get to you and church and a self-soothing, autobiographical memory. That's just a memory that makes you feel good. It could be anything, first pet, first kiss, whatever. For me, it's you smiling at me. My family went back for a visit about a year after we moved. You and I saw each other before church. You didn't know I was back. We talked. We caught up. We smiled at each other during the service. That was the first time I ever flirted with a girl. I have Social Anxiety Disorder on top of the Asperger's, so that's not easy for me. When you smiled at me, you gave me butterflies.\\n\\nFor forty years, I used that memory as intended. It didn't help if things were really bad, but, as a quick pick-me-up, it was fine. Every time, it gave me butterflies. That's the Asperger's. We can sometimes recall the full emotional effect of an event.\\n\\nWhat I didn't know is that the self-soothing part is a release of dopamine and oxytocin. They were giving me the butterflies. I've studied psychology. I took it for the humanities credits and liked it. I use it when developing my characters. I've also used it to research my conditions, but I never researched that memory. I had no reason to.\\n\\nFor forty years, I released dopamine and oxytocin into my system with that memory. As far as I can tell, they functioned as intended: reinforcing memory pathways of that memory and all of the other memories I have of you, because I would think of all of them, and linking them to a positive emotional response. In a neurotypical brain, that wouldn't be the case. The amount of oxytocin from other sources would mostly drown out the amount from the self-soothing memory. In an Asperger brain, especially one with Social Anxiety Disorder, it would be different. Every drop would be noticed.\\n\\nAround Thanksgiving, I hyperfocused on you. It's a common ADD trait. Usually, it's about a project I'm working on. It's great at work. I can get a lot done. This time, it happened to be about you. When it's about a person, I search for a lot of information online, then stop. I never save it; I never reach out to the person; I just search. I think it satisfies some hunting instinct. That is what has happened every other time. I focused on you twice before. That's what happened. The first time was about twenty-five years ago. I was searching for a lot of people then. I wanted to see what search engines could do. The second time was when I moved to the area. That's when I saw you were married. I still used that memory of you, because I wasn't hurting anyone, but that was it.\\n\\nWhen I focused on you this third time, I didn't think anything of it. It seemed like any other episode. I found your LinkedIn page. I think I found your Twitter page. I found that photo of you. You looked good. That should have been it. I should have stopped. Instead, I sank into severe depression. I don't have a history of depression. I had no idea where it came from. Over the course of three weeks, I went from completely normal to crippling depression. If anyone had asked me about you in November, I would have said nice things. I would have said you were someone I had a crush on once. That would have been it. Suddenly, you were the only thing I could think about.\\n\\nSo, I wrote an essay about you. I'm a writer, and it can sometimes clear my head. And it did help. It ended the episode and eased the depression. I thought I was better. But, I had this essay, and it told me the impossible. It didn't say it explicitly, but it did say it. I had to reconcile everything I knew about my life and about Asperger's with what the essay told me. That's when I researched that memory. That was the only thing different about you and every other woman I ever thought about. I found information on oxytocin release and reinforced pathways. Some of it is speculation, but it's reasonable, and it doesn't violate anything. I had a mechanism, and it explained a few things. Minor details, but it maintained consistency. I knew I succeeded.\\n\\nThis is where it gets uncomfortable.\\n\\nReinforced memory pathways linked to a positive emotional response is the neurological mechanism of falling in love. Without knowing what I was doing, I fell in love with you.\\n\\nAgain, I did this to myself. I've known that from the beginning. I never thought you felt the same way. You had a neurotypical life. And you did nothing wrong. You don't owe me anything. I don't expect anything from you. Not ever. I want you to understand: I'm not delusional, I'm not irrational, and I'm not stupid. I never thought you would upend your life for me. If I thought that, I would have told you all of this in December. I created this self-contained soap opera. I've tried to deal with it myself, but I can't.\\n\\nI'm not sure if you understand what I did, exactly. I didn't cure Asperger's. I found a loophole, but it only worked once. I didn't have other self-soothing memories. If I'd spread the oxytocin too thin, it wouldn't have worked. You're the only person in the world I love. Probably, the only one I will ever love. I don't have the time or the associated memories to do this again, and I don't have anyone else in my life like you. You weren't the only woman to flirt with me, you weren't the only one to smile at me, but I used the memory of you over and over for a reason. You were the best I ever found. Honestly, I don't want to love someone else, even if it means depression for the rest of my life.\\n\\nI want to tell you, the emotion itself is very normal. It's very healthy; it's very stable. It feels a bit like contentment. Apparently, the processing part of my brain works exactly the way it should.\\n\\nAs I said, I'm here for therapy. I was getting worse, and I needed to deal with this part of it. I also needed the guilt to keep me away from you. The other reason is because I can't move on. I create scenarios about you in my head. That's a writer's habit, not specific to this situation. But, every day for six months, I have fantasized that you're getting a divorce.\\n\\nI hate myself for that.\\n\\nAt the beginning, that was the only thing I could think. Literally. I had days in December when you were the only thought in my head. I have ADD. I've *never* had one thought in my head all day. Later, the fantasies were the only thing that kept me functional. They were the only times I felt close to happy. But I can't stop. I know it's not healthy, but the real answer hurts too much. I pull away from it every time. I've reached the point that I can accept I'm not with you now if I can pretend I'll be with you later. I can't face the idea that I'll never be with you. I know the truth, but I need to hear it from you. I won't listen to it from anyone else, not my family, not my therapist, and not me. You're the person I had to tell, and you're the person who needs to respond. And I hate that. I'm not strong enough to do this myself.\\n\\nThe problem is the Asperger's. I don't have a support system in place. I don't know how to be in love. I've never done it before, and I'm not very good at it. I also don't have anyone around me who can help. My family would want to. I know that. But they can't. They've tried comforting me before for whatever it was at the time. It never worked. I heard the words, but I didn't have the connection to the person. They were just words. I've been given a crash course in the worst part of love with no kind of support. My therapist tries, but she can't do much either.\\n\\nAnd, I want my life back. I don't have that right now. I have work and you. And pain that freezes me or leaves me sobbing.\\n\\nI have a good idea what your response will be, and I will feel like crap for the next few months. Or years. But that's for me to worry about. You will go back to your life, and I will be a hiccup in your day or a blip on your screen. You probably don't believe any of it. I'm not offended. But I know what I did. When I think about you, I can feel it. I can't imagine anything else feeling that good or hurting that much.\\n\\nI'm not sorry I fell in love with you. I will never be sorry for that. You were the best I ever found, and I will love you for the rest of my life. This emotion is too important to me, and you are too important to me. Depression is a small price to pay.\\n\\nOnce more, I will never reach out to you again, or anyone around you. I will not go near you. I promise.\\n\\nThat's it. I hope you don't hate me, even though I probably deserve it. I'm not horrible; I'm just in pain.\\n\\nNow, it's your turn. Please respond as honestly as possible.\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-05-29T20:01:46.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate going to you about this.

But, every day for six months, I have fantasized that you&amp;#39;re getting a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hate myself for that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, that was the only thing I could think. Literally. I had days in December when you were the only thought in my head. I have ADD. I&amp;#39;ve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; had one thought in my head all day. Later, the fantasies were the only thing that kept me functional. They were the only times I felt close to happy. But I can&amp;#39;t stop. I know it&amp;#39;s not healthy, but the real answer hurts too much. I pull away from it every time. I&amp;#39;ve reached the point that I can accept I&amp;#39;m not with you now if I can pretend I&amp;#39;ll be with you later. I can&amp;#39;t face the idea that I&amp;#39;ll never be with you. I know the truth, but I need to hear it from you. I won&amp;#39;t listen to it from anyone else, not my family, not my therapist, and not me. You&amp;#39;re the person I had to tell, and you&amp;#39;re the person who needs to respond. And I hate that. I&amp;#39;m not strong enough to do this myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The problem is the Asperger&amp;#39;s. I don&amp;#39;t have a support system in place. I don&amp;#39;t know how to be in love. I&amp;#39;ve never done it before, and I&amp;#39;m not very good at it. I also don&amp;#39;t have anyone around me who can help. My family would want to. I know that. But they can&amp;#39;t. They&amp;#39;ve tried comforting me before for whatever it was at the time. It never worked. I heard the words, but I didn&amp;#39;t have the connection to the person. They were just words. I&amp;#39;ve been given a crash course in the worst part of love with no kind of support. My therapist tries, but she can&amp;#39;t do much either.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And, I want my life back. I don&amp;#39;t have that right now. I have work and you. And pain that freezes me or leaves me sobbing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have a good idea what your response will be, and I will feel like crap for the next few months. Or years. But that&amp;#39;s for me to worry about. You will go back to your life, and I will be a hiccup in your day or a blip on your screen. You probably don&amp;#39;t believe any of it. I&amp;#39;m not offended. But I know what I did. When I think about you, I can feel it. I can&amp;#39;t imagine anything else feeling that good or hurting that much.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sorry I fell in love with you. I will never be sorry for that. You were the best I ever found, and I will love you for the rest of my life. This emotion is too important to me, and you are too important to me. Depression is a small price to pay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once more, I will never reach out to you again, or anyone around you. I will not go near you. I promise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. I hope you don&amp;#39;t hate me, even though I probably deserve it. I&amp;#39;m not horrible; I&amp;#39;m just in pain.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;#39;s your turn. Please respond as honestly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 9,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/13v4wyt/what_i_would_say_to_you/\",\n            \"username\": \"KhalibanMoore\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_13v0tp8\": {\n            \"title\": \"You are precious to me.\",\n            \"body\": \"Dear lover.\\n\\nI'm changing for you.

I thought I had it all figured out, but together I think we were two souls loving each other who were too young to do it properly.

Just knowing you are out there radiating your warmth makes me happy that I walk the same Earth as you. You are such a kind, compassionate, vibrant soul. You are a loving, supportive, and a gentle man with a sensitive heart that I wish I could have protected better. You are the version of all the things that you saw me as. \\n\\nYou don't settle for less. You are too much of a dreamer and romantic to settle for someone who does not share the same vibration as you. You have been more true to yourself than I to myself. You support and cheer people on always. You get emotional and insecure and feel your thoughts when that green monster gets a hold of you. But that version of you isn't a monster, it is your younger self being scared. It's okay to be scared! The scary unknown is what makes life exciting, right? I hope your 30s are spent exploring the unknown and not being too scared to dive in to it. I will finish off my 20s that way with that thought in mind. \\n\\nI'm sorry for the belated birthday message that I don't even get to send you anyway. You pushed me to become the best I can be. I am forever grateful to you and I will cherish and love you like no other. Even at a distance. I hope the next person to win your heart sees how truly special and one of a kind it is. \\n\\nI love you to the moon and back again. \\nThank you for just being you. I'm proud of the version you are and have yet to become. \\n\\n\\ud83c\\udf3b\\u2600\\ufe0f\\ud83c\\udf19\\ud83d\\udc99\\ud83e\\udd68\\ud83c\\udf86\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-05-27T19:54:56.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You always sent me the most loving and caring messages for birthdays, holidays, or just whenever you wanted to love me in that way.

But I see how young we both were. I thought I had it all figured out, but together I think we were two souls loving each other who were too young to do it properly. You were both my first and second love and have taught me everything I know about love. Lessons of love that I take with me everywhere I go.

I was surprised, but I couldn\\u2019t bring myself to ask who the lucky girl was/is.

Except today, the world is bright, coloured with bright oranges, inviting pinks and burning reds. Where the hotness of the sun used to give me headaches, it now fills me with pleasant exhaustion. Today, the warmth in the air floats around me like an upbeat song, and smells of all the good things in the world. Here I am, in summer, happy at long last. I'm at the end of the journey, and though I know there is no happily ever after, I've never felt more at peace. There was a time, lifetimes ago but only just a year from now, where the past troubled me, where the present slipped through my fingers and the future seemed unbearable. There was a time where I was in love with you.\\n\\nThis is my farewell. Farewell, to the feelings that I once desperately clang on to. Farewell, love, and thank you for all that you have taught me. Farewell, love, and thank you for making me into the person that I have become. Though the pain spread through me like poison, and turned me rotten on the inside, I've come out stronger, happier, and better. That is why, my unfortunate companion, I regret nothing. All the love that I held heavy in my heart is gone, all the hate that I had for myself has been replaced with pride and wonder. Farewell, love, and thank you for all that I discovered through you, the wonderful stories and the magnificent songs that at a time, I kept going back to, just like I kept going back to that precious someone who I've come to realise was never more than the ghost of a friend long gone. Thank you so much, love, and farewell.\\n\\nI hope you fare well, love, wherever you are now. I hope that our futures, now untangled from each other, will be everything that we used to hope for back when we were young and in love. Beautiful. Exciting. I hold such dear memories of you, and I will always cherish them. Farewell, my long lost friend, and thank you for being there at a time of my life where I wasn't quite here. Thank you for everytime you made me laugh so hard I cried, for all the adventures that we had together, for all the compliments that you gave me. The memories that we made together, that I see in the streets when I walk around the city. From now on I promise, I'll always look back on them with a smile.

Except today, the world is bright, coloured with bright oranges, inviting pinks and burning reds. Where the hotness of the sun used to give me headaches, it now fills me with pleasant exhaustion. Today, the warmth in the air floats around me like an upbeat song, and smells of all the good things in the world. Here I am, in summer, happy at long last. I&amp;#39;m at the end of the journey, and though I know there is no happily ever after, I&amp;#39;ve never felt more at peace. There was a time, lifetimes ago but only just a year from now, where the past troubled me, where the present slipped through my fingers and the future seemed unbearable. There was a time where I was in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is my farewell. Farewell, to the feelings that I once desperately clang on to. Farewell, love, and thank you for all that you have taught me. Farewell, love, and thank you for making me into the person that I have become. Though the pain spread through me like poison, and turned me rotten on the inside, I&amp;#39;ve come out stronger, happier, and better. That is why, my unfortunate companion, I regret nothing. All the love that I held heavy in my heart is gone, all the hate that I had for myself has been replaced with pride and wonder. Farewell, love, and thank you for all that I discovered through you, the wonderful stories and the magnificent songs that at a time, I kept going back to, just like I kept going back to that precious someone who I&amp;#39;ve come to realise was never more than the ghost of a friend long gone. Thank you so much, love, and farewell.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you fare well, love, wherever you are now. I hope that our futures, now untangled from each other, will be everything that we used to hope for back when we were young and in love. Beautiful. Exciting. I hold such dear memories of you, and I will always cherish them. Farewell, my long lost friend, and thank you for being there at a time of my life where I wasn&amp;#39;t quite here. Thank you for everytime you made me laugh so hard I cried, for all the adventures that we had together, for all the compliments that you gave me. The memories that we made together, that I see in the streets when I walk around the city. From now on I promise, I&amp;#39;ll always look back on them with a smile. You know, love, even though this is a goodbye, you&amp;#39;ll always be a part of me - in everything that you made me discover, in all the things that you opened my eyes to.

I think it's you, at any rate. I want it to have been you, because it was nice. I know you always say it's not about me and never to me, and that they'll never be to me. So, I don't respond like I would actually want to. I don't respond at all. I am the forgotten one hahaha, who would have fucking thought? Me, of all people? Forgotten? Damn.\\n\\nThose hopes are dashed, though, and I am well aware my lot in life. \\n\\nThis is just me screaming out into that void in an ever increasing pitch, desperately hoping to shatter through this flawed reality, hoping that I can maybe slip through space and casually slide on in to another dimension. One where things are finally \\\"right\\\" again. One where I didn't ever lose us. \\n\\n\\nYou said that you have found yourself in an apathetic mindstate recently. That you don't feel close to me anymore, as well, and that you no longer care for yourself. \\n\\nMore than anything you've ever said, regardless of how fake it probably is, (as apparently it all has been) this still had a profound impact on me. Which, obviously that was the intent. \\n\\nIt hit me, and it made me feel as if that last bit of any bond between us is now truly broken. To me, that bond is divinely wrought, the masterpiece of my life, and something truly sacred. It represents the very essence of our connection\\u2014the quintessential spark, a perfection that everybody dreams and wishes for, but that we were lucky enough to have found. The thing that started it all... For me, it was an extraordinary and deeply significant bond, what with our oddly seamless collaboration, our shared and swiftly agreed upon strategies, and then our subsequent countless adventures together. Through some tough moments, stupid choices, stupid manipulations, and I'm sure plenty of mistakes that I will never get to know about. All of that, but mostly the dumb shit we did together which were some of the best memories of my entire life, and the incredible shift of an era for you in your life that we shared together, in the name of fun, of love, and of discovery. \\n\\nDoing stupid shit like staying up for three days straight and basically talking through that entire time 24/7. I remember my phone used to get so damn hot on my face hahaha. I occassionally would put it in the freezer when we switched to discord, I remember. Throughout it all, and it was... 5 months? Or 6? I'm not sure, but throughout that time, you displayed a remarkable resilience in your discipline which I truly NEVER expected at all. I don't think I ever expressed how proud of you I was for that, but there you go. You somehow found, despite never having it at all before that I'm aware of, what really was an unwavering motivation. \\n\\nWe had talked about love prior to that moment, but I distinctly remember that was the actual moment where it ascended because I was genuinely *impressed* by you. You know that's something I almost never am, since I'm so tremendously talented(arrogant). To my mind, our bond was swiftly growing into something beyond anything I'd ever experienced before leading up to you moving in. The bond was truly distinct because it served as a sort of irrefutable proof of our love for one another. A proof that NOBODY could ever steal from us, never harm, and was something we could always look to in times of difficulty. It was beautiful in my mind, everything I'd ever wanted. \\n\\nWhich, of course that means that for me, it was a bond that could never be broken. Unfortunately, this invincibility was only from my side of things, it seems... I understand that you didn't and do not see it in the same light. I've known for... well, since the day before my birthday. I know you still primarily harbor feelings of animosity towards me, even. That you're constantly trying to manipulate me for whatever reason, though I haven't got a clue exaclty. I can make some guesses. However, I can't view it any other way than what it truly was, or at least should have been.\\n\\nNevertheless, I believe that you have the ability to easily achieve that status for yourself if you are ever of the mind to do so again. When you were motivated, you always achieved great things. Even if it was motivation propelled by spite or hatred towards me.  \\n\\n\\nYou talked about not self harming, which I hope you just never do again because I said you couldn't. You talked also about being numb, though. This IRKED me, and do you know why? Because. It. Does. Not. Work. For. You. \\n\\nI'm glad to hear that you won't go down the selfharm path, but don't resort to numbing yourself, goober. I despised that whole numbing routine of yours, and we've talked about it so many times. C'mon... It's the known root cause of an astounding number of your almost universally unhealthy coping mechanisms. And, as I said, it just straight up doesn't work for you. Honestly, I know you can't often, if ever, truly numb your emotions for yourself, because that's just not who you are. You're a fraud in this regard and I'm now WELL aware of that because of how much damage that caused us... \\n\\nYou experience your emotions acutely and intensely, and almost always far more than you should. There's a reason for this, but I won't get into that now. That's where a lot of your issues stem from, though, like I said. You never allowed yourself to simply feel something and turn to me in order to find my constant reassurance. I had to seek out your hurt, and this created a lot of our animosity and resentment because you always expected that. \\n\\nI hope you get past that tendency, and learn to freely express your emotions to be taken care of like everybody else. You're not wrong for feeling things. I hate that I didn't even truly know how far it went, how much you had always just hidden your pain. There are so many things that you didn't tell me that profoundly hurt us, and hate thinking about it. You say you're numbing yourself, but really, at best you're pushing those feelings aside, and then you know what happens next? You go mental boom, psychosis mode, and those thoughts spiral into those dark, uncontrollable thoughts of yours. I'm not saying self-harm is a better option, but there are other alternatives aside, you know. \\n\\nSpeaking of self-harm, though... I look back at that one time you did it when you were with me, and strangely enough, I have a certain fondness for it. (It's not even close to the strangeness of another of one of my fondest memories, though.) It showed a level of maturity that you rarely displayed, along with the depth of respect you had for me during that period. I was genuinely shocked when you actually listened the first time I told you it wasn't acceptable to me. I remember telling you it was cringe and just so unnecessary to do something like that when I loved you so much. I do remember it was the first time I was kind of like, \\\"Wow, you actually are a little crazy, huh,\\\" but you just... never did it again (at least, not to my knowledge\\u2014who knows, really).\\n\\nIt's unfortunate that in the past, you struggled to love your body when you were with me, although there was a period where I truly felt you were proud of yourself. And let me tell you, I was proud of you the entire time. Not a single moment went by where I wasn't, and I hope you truly understand that.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut then you said you've given up mentally... :(\\n\\n\\nWell, I guess this is as good a time as any to get it all out there. I'm fully aware that there were times and ways in which you viewed my actions as truly wrong or hurtful towards you. I could see where, if viewed from a certain light perhaps, how I could be construed as a dick at times, even. I also wasn't a mind reader, so I think there could be some accounting there from both our ends. But, I do want to apologize for the last bit of our relationship especially... Looking back, those conversations on Between (sidenote: I miss Between, and you're probably using it with someone else now) that were towards the end make me cringe so hard and feel pretty ashamed. I don't want anybody to see them or ever be that way again. :| \\n\\nThe truth is... I was mentally checked out, I was in so much pain because of everything and just felt like I was worthless because things didn't work out, and I was just exploding because I *tried so fucking hard for so long*. I took that out on you, unfortunately, and it's probably the case that that was unfair of me. You were so inexperienced and just weren't prepared to go through so many things that were so difficult, and truly unfair for us both, just one after another... The hits kept coming at us, and I lost my grip when I felt you were no longer on my side. I lost my vision and my will. Badger passing was probably the end of my good days. \\n\\nI know you know, at least a little, how profoundly his death shook me... I would have, without question, traded spots with him in an instant. I obviously still would. I didn't pull it together with all the other hard shit going on, and with you... I needed your support and reassurance so badly, and I don't know if I was delusional or what, but I just never felt I got it. It was so hard, and I know we both could blame a lot of things, many of them on one another as welll as outside of you and I entirely. At the end of the day, we both went through fucking hell and we did it together, just not in the way we should have. I see fault in both of us, I know I regret not putting in more effort to try and understand your inexperience, but truthfully I don't remember it all that well anyways. \\n\\nI just wish we could have collaborated, like the old times, and been able to come to understand that we were both hurting, yes, but it was together and it wasn't one another's \\\"faults\\\" necessarily. Our plans got fucking nuked, L, and it kicked us both in the face in a traumatic way. I know I tried at many points, but I felt like you wouldn't just give me your all ever. I tried towards the end, though it was far less patient and angry than I had been in the past. You reciprocated in your own way, but you did so independantly... Which, unfortunately, I more or less took a great deal of offense to that. \\n\\n\\nI have said many dumb things, many smart things, and many pointless things. I've pointed fingers, I've flexed out of the way to avoid blame, and I've hurt both of us. No matter what I have done, said, or otherwise impressed upon you while mired within my rapidly shifting emotions, oscillating between incredible fear, anger, and grief, I want you to know that, to ME, our status and our love, was ALWAYS something legendary. I can honestly say that throughout the entire relationship, despite everything, and even up to today, I never stopped wanting you. Never doubt this. I know you don't feel the same, but I don't give a fuck, I'll still tell the truth. If you want to judge me for it, judge away. I won't rewrite history about how I feel. \\n\\nIt devastated me to discover that it was never reciprocrated... it was all just a nice little delusion of mine, and that it was only me who ever truly felt that way. Learning that you had actually moved on entirely as well, especially for such a long time before you even left, just fucking shattered me for a bit there.\\n\\nI'd like to say that I'm so much more than just the sum of my worst moments/lowest points, but I don't think it matters to you. I know you have a pretty low opinion of me, and that really sucks too, because I think you're a fucking dumbass for that. I wish you would stop taking every opportunity to just ruthlessly kick me in the face when I'm already down, especially when it's for no easily discernible reason.\\n\\nHonestly, I couldn't care less about what anybody else says about me, it doesn't matter what it is that they want to say, because they simply don't know the real me. I'm aware that you've spread an ungodly amount of lies about me out into the ether, as well as directly to other people, and that hurts a lot, I won't lie. However, in a twisted way, if I REALLY stretch the limits of my capacity to lie to myself, it *almost* feels as if you at least tried to \\\"protect\\\" me, the \\\"real me\\\" at least, in a sense. You could say I've been virtually untouched, if you delude yourself enoguh. \\n\\nI wish I could believe that it were true, but deep down, I know better. :(\\n\\nI genuinely hope you're doing well. I find it unlikely you'd bother to read anything I said to this point, but who knows. I don't expect us to talk and I've made peace with that even though it sucked horribly and took me 4 fucking months. This will likely be my final message, because I finally said the hard things I truly didn't want to say and I felt the things I didn't want to feel as a consequence. \\n\\nI can only imagine the impending harrassment from the local brainlets with some new information to sort out between them here. \\n\\nI'm sorry for everything, and I Love You,\\n\\n- B.C.\\n\\n\\nPS: Quit sending me magazines you little bitch. &lt;3\\nPSS: But do send me a letter maybe someday, since that seems to be your thing for everybody except for me.\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-05-18T23:22:50.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to this, I read one of &amp;quot;your&amp;quot; letters. I think it&amp;#39;s you, at any rate. I want it to have been you, because it was nice. I know you always say it&amp;#39;s not about me and never to me, and that they&amp;#39;ll never be to me. So, I don&amp;#39;t respond like I would actually want to. I don&amp;#39;t respond at all. I am the forgotten one hahaha, who would have fucking thought? Me, of all people? Forgotten? Damn.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Those hopes are dashed, though, and I am well aware my lot in life. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is just me screaming out into that void in an ever increasing pitch, desperately hoping to shatter through this flawed reality, hoping that I can maybe slip through space and casually slide on in to another dimension. One where things are finally &amp;quot;right&amp;quot; again. One where I didn&amp;#39;t ever lose us. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You said that you have found yourself in an apathetic mindstate recently. That you don&amp;#39;t feel close to me anymore, as well, and that you no longer care for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;More than anything you&amp;#39;ve ever said, regardless of how fake it probably is, (as apparently it all has been) this still had a profound impact on me. Which, obviously that was the intent. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It hit me, and it made me feel as if that last bit of any bond between us is now truly broken. To me, that bond is divinely wrought, the masterpiece of my life, and something truly sacred. It represents the very essence of our connection\\u2014the quintessential spark, a perfection that everybody dreams and wishes for, but that we were lucky enough to have found. The thing that started it all... For me, it was an extraordinary and deeply significant bond, what with our oddly seamless collaboration, our shared and swiftly agreed upon strategies, and then our subsequent countless adventures together. Through some tough moments, stupid choices, stupid manipulations, and I&amp;#39;m sure plenty of mistakes that I will never get to know about. All of that, but mostly the dumb shit we did together which were some of the best memories of my entire life, and the incredible shift of an era for you in your life that we shared together, in the name of fun, of love, and of discovery. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Doing stupid shit like staying up for three days straight and basically talking through that entire time 24/7. I remember my phone used to get so damn hot on my face hahaha. I occassionally would put it in the freezer when we switched to discord, I remember. Throughout it all, and it was... 5 months? Or 6? I&amp;#39;m not sure, but throughout that time, you displayed a remarkable resilience in your discipline which I truly NEVER expected at all. I don&amp;#39;t think I ever expressed how proud of you I was for that, but there you go. You somehow found, despite never having it at all before that I&amp;#39;m aware of, what really was an unwavering motivation. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We had talked about love prior to that moment, but I distinctly remember that was the actual moment where it ascended because I was genuinely &lt;em&gt;impressed&lt;/em&gt; by you. You know that&amp;#39;s something I almost never am, since I&amp;#39;m so tremendously talented(arrogant). To my mind, our bond was swiftly growing into something beyond anything I&amp;#39;d ever experienced before leading up to you moving in. The bond was truly distinct because it served as a sort of irrefutable proof of our love for one another. A proof that NOBODY could ever steal from us, never harm, and was something we could always look to in times of difficulty. It was beautiful in my mind, everything I&amp;#39;d ever wanted. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Which, of course that means that for me, it was a bond that could never be broken. Unfortunately, this invincibility was only from my side of things, it seems... I understand that you didn&amp;#39;t and do not see it in the same light. I&amp;#39;ve known for... well, since the day before my birthday. I know you still primarily harbor feelings of animosity towards me, even. That you&amp;#39;re constantly trying to manipulate me for whatever reason, though I haven&amp;#39;t got a clue exaclty. I can make some guesses. However, I can&amp;#39;t view it any other way than what it truly was, or at least should have been.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I believe that you have the ability to easily achieve that status for yourself if you are ever of the mind to do so again. When you were motivated, you always achieved great things. Even if it was motivation propelled by spite or hatred towards me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You talked about not self harming, which I hope you just never do again because I said you couldn&amp;#39;t. You talked also about being numb, though. This IRKED me, and do you know why? Because. It. Does. Not. Work. For. You. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m glad to hear that you won&amp;#39;t go down the selfharm path, but don&amp;#39;t resort to numbing yourself, goober. I despised that whole numbing routine of yours, and we&amp;#39;ve talked about it so many times. C&amp;#39;mon... It&amp;#39;s the known root cause of an astounding number of your almost universally unhealthy coping mechanisms. And, as I said, it just straight up doesn&amp;#39;t work for you. Honestly, I know you can&amp;#39;t often, if ever, truly numb your emotions for yourself, because that&amp;#39;s just not who you are. You&amp;#39;re a fraud in this regard and I&amp;#39;m now WELL aware of that because of how much damage that caused us... &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You experience your emotions acutely and intensely, and almost always far more than you should. There&amp;#39;s a reason for this, but I won&amp;#39;t get into that now. That&amp;#39;s where a lot of your issues stem from, though, like I said. You never allowed yourself to simply feel something and turn to me in order to find my constant reassurance. I had to seek out your hurt, and this created a lot of our animosity and resentment because you always expected that. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you get past that tendency, and learn to freely express your emotions to be taken care of like everybody else. You&amp;#39;re not wrong for feeling things. I hate that I didn&amp;#39;t even truly know how far it went, how much you had always just hidden your pain. There are so many things that you didn&amp;#39;t tell me that profoundly hurt us, and hate thinking about it. You say you&amp;#39;re numbing yourself, but really, at best you&amp;#39;re pushing those feelings aside, and then you know what happens next? You go mental boom, psychosis mode, and those thoughts spiral into those dark, uncontrollable thoughts of yours. I&amp;#39;m not saying self-harm is a better option, but there are other alternatives aside, you know. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of self-harm, though... I look back at that one time you did it when you were with me, and strangely enough, I have a certain fondness for it. (It&amp;#39;s not even close to the strangeness of another of one of my fondest memories, though.) It showed a level of maturity that you rarely displayed, along with the depth of respect you had for me during that period. I was genuinely shocked when you actually listened the first time I told you it wasn&amp;#39;t acceptable to me. I remember telling you it was cringe and just so unnecessary to do something like that when I loved you so much. I do remember it was the first time I was kind of like, &amp;quot;Wow, you actually are a little crazy, huh,&amp;quot; but you just... never did it again (at least, not to my knowledge\\u2014who knows, really).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s unfortunate that in the past, you struggled to love your body when you were with me, although there was a period where I truly felt you were proud of yourself. And let me tell you, I was proud of you the entire time. Not a single moment went by where I wasn&amp;#39;t, and I hope you truly understand that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But then you said you&amp;#39;ve given up mentally... :(&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess this is as good a time as any to get it all out there. I&amp;#39;m fully aware that there were times and ways in which you viewed my actions as truly wrong or hurtful towards you. I could see where, if viewed from a certain light perhaps, how I could be construed as a dick at times, even. I also wasn&amp;#39;t a mind reader, so I think there could be some accounting there from both our ends. But, I do want to apologize for the last bit of our relationship especially...

You taught her that you won\\u2019t show up when she needs you. You taught her how to count on someone else.\\n\\nDon\\u2019t be surprised when she spends more time with her friends than you. You taught her that you\\u2019re never going to be present. You don\\u2019t listen when she speaks. You don\\u2019t remember the things she told you. You don\\u2019t ask about how she\\u2019s feeling or what\\u2019s bothering her. You taught her that you\\u2019ll never care about her as much as her friends do.\\n\\n\\nDon\\u2019t be surprised when she starts planning things without you. You taught her that you\\u2019ll always say no. You taught her how to plan her future without you. You taught her that you don\\u2019t want to be in it, that you\\u2019d rather be alone than with her.

I really hope you like the switch, it was so hard to keep that a secret but I am so excited to see your face when you open it. Don\\u2019t forget to send me the video!\\n\\nAnyway, i\\u2019ve rewritten this about a dozen times\\u2026trying to figure out how to say what i\\u2019m trying to properly and not in a scary way. Meeting you has been one of the best and worst things that has happened to me.\\n\\nThe best because you make me so happy, I never thought i\\u2019d meet someone who genuinely cares about me and tries their best, despite the circumstances, to care for my needs in the relationship and make me comfortable. Someone who would assure me that i\\u2019m not doing the most and work together to fix something that\\u2019s not working. When I was little, I always fantasized about growing old and sharing my life with someone who loved me for me and wanted nothing else. Someone who just got me and didn\\u2019t want me to change. \\nGetting to know you and spending the time that we have with one another, I think that you\\u2019re the one i\\u2019ve been asking for. The most attractive person i\\u2019ve ever seen, who has a good heart, similar morals, similar goals, and is just an all around amazing person. You make me feel so giddy, sending butterflies to my stomach and flutters to my heart.\\nI\\u2019ve never thought about getting married, I saw my parents go through a horrible divorce, and after that I just never really saw the point if they just ended like that. I didn\\u2019t plan the location or the dress like some people because I never thought i\\u2019d be in that position anyway. But when you asked me, and said you\\u2019d want to eventually, I found myself being more open to the idea. If that\\u2019s something you want, i\\u2019ll be damned if someone else gives it to you just because I was too scared. Isn\\u2019t that crazy?? I\\u2019d do anything for you, anything to make you happy. Anything to be able to call you mine. I\\u2019d feel like the luckiest person on this planet if you chose me. (I would like to reiterate that i\\u2019m not saying let\\u2019s get married tomorrow, just that the idea of it happening period is not as scary) \\n\\nI also say meeting you is one of the worst things for all the same reasons it\\u2019s been the best. Having all of these emotions is really scary. I don\\u2019t have the best history in relationships. One of them, I will take fault for it going sour, but the rest have just been people taking what they want from me and then leaving me empty. Emptier than I was before they found me. When we met, I had just gotten broken up with a month before and I was so so so broken. I had given my all into something that I was told was reciprocated and I ended up getting played. I didn\\u2019t have high hopes getting back out there, and then I met you. It felt too good to be true, it still does most times, but you made me smile so easily, so quickly, it felt wrong. Sometimes I still feel like you\\u2019ll get up one day and be like \\u2018nah\\u2019\\u2026like you\\u2019ll finally come to your senses and realize that you could get somebody better, someone prettier and easier for you. That you\\u2019ll just be another person to empty me and leave. I guess that\\u2019s my baggage and not yours. So i\\u2019m trying to stay hopeful and not self sabotage. You see how it\\u2019s the best and worst thing? I am so in love with you that you have the power to make my days or ruin them.\\n\\nAnd I guess that\\u2019s what i\\u2019m trying to say, in the most long winded way, that I am in love with you. I wrote it here because I would quite literally collapse into a bag of bones if I tried to tell you in person, but I just couldn\\u2019t wait anymore. I\\u2019ve been feeling like this for a few months now, but I know 8 months is a little early so I sure as hell wasn\\u2019t going to tell you at 4. You seem like the type of person to take things slow and I didn\\u2019t want to scare you away by moving too fast or making you uncomfortable. I could list all of the things I love about you but I doubt you feel like reading a novel right now so i\\u2019ll just say it\\u2019s literally everything. \\n\\nInstead, i\\u2019ll list some of the things that i\\u2019m looking forward to doing with you :)\\n\\n(cont. in comments)\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-05-02T09:50:10.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;for my loves birthday \\nI wrote you two notes, read this one when you\\u2019re alone :)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hi baby :)\\nHopefully you\\u2019ve saved this for later when you\\u2019re alone, and maybe have some time to process. I really hope you like the switch, it was so hard to keep that a secret but I am so excited to see your face when you open it. Don\\u2019t forget to send me the video!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, i\\u2019ve rewritten this about a dozen times\\u2026trying to figure out how to say what i\\u2019m trying to properly and not in a scary way. Meeting you has been one of the best and worst things that has happened to me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The best because you make me so happy, I never thought i\\u2019d meet someone who genuinely cares about me and tries their best, despite the circumstances, to care for my needs in the relationship and make me comfortable. Someone who would assure me that i\\u2019m not doing the most and work together to fix something that\\u2019s not working. When I was little, I always fantasized about growing old and sharing my life with someone who loved me for me and wanted nothing else. Someone who just got me and didn\\u2019t want me to change. \\nGetting to know you and spending the time that we have with one another, I think that you\\u2019re the one i\\u2019ve been asking for. The most attractive person i\\u2019ve ever seen, who has a good heart, similar morals, similar goals, and is just an all around amazing person. You make me feel so giddy, sending butterflies to my stomach and flutters to my heart.\\nI\\u2019ve never thought about getting married, I saw my parents go through a horrible divorce, and after that I just never really saw the point if they just ended like that. I didn\\u2019t plan the location or the dress like some people because I never thought i\\u2019d be in that position anyway. But when you asked me, and said you\\u2019d want to eventually, I found myself being more open to the idea. If that\\u2019s something you want, i\\u2019ll be damned if someone else gives it to you just because I was too scared. Isn\\u2019t that crazy?? I\\u2019d do anything for you, anything to make you happy. Anything to be able to call you mine. I\\u2019d feel like the luckiest person on this planet if you chose me. (I would like to reiterate that i\\u2019m not saying let\\u2019s get married tomorrow, just that the idea of it happening period is not as scary) &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I also say meeting you is one of the worst things for all the same reasons it\\u2019s been the best. Having all of these emotions is really scary. I don\\u2019t have the best history in relationships. One of them, I will take fault for it going sour, but the rest have just been people taking what they want from me and then leaving me empty. Emptier than I was before they found me. When we met, I had just gotten broken up with a month before and I was so so so broken. I had given my all into something that I was told was reciprocated and I ended up getting played. I didn\\u2019t have high hopes getting back out there, and then I met you. It felt too good to be true, it still does most times, but you made me smile so easily, so quickly, it felt wrong.

Ask me what I think, why I think it, and if I am foolishly running when I should be lightly treading. Just don't shut me out or look away and deny me the starlight of your eyes. I am an Aries, I am as transparent as a canary diamond, clear blue skies, or the sliding glass door we all run into in our youth.\\n\\nYou are my passing infatuation...\\n\\nYou are my muse, my inspiration, most definitely not a passing infatuation. After some contemplation I have come to understand why you call yourself an infatuation. You describe yourself as a shiny object of momentary distraction... \\\"and I picture a cat playing with a shiny tinkling bell.\\\" The real truth is buried between your words, the words that you use to build walls and defend yourself. I am not infatuated, for that is an emotion for cats and small children. Infatuation does not inspire poems, art, music playlists, loss of sleep, and most of all a sense of longing. I have given you full access into the circus tent of my life for which I am the ring leader. Meanwhile you have used words, psychology, astrology, and anything else you could reach to build moats, traps, and obstacles. You are absolutely right... I know only the little bits you have chosen to show me, because you have chosen to show me so little.\\n\\nYou meet my requirements, and so I have fallen for you like a lost puppy dog...\\n\\nThis would be true if I was a lost, hungry, and exhausted puppy dog in need of rescue. But I am not, and at most you have patted my head and called me a good boy, but otherwise walked away. Recently I laid in sleepless contemplation while my thoughts played pong inside my skull. I realized that I have been absolutely open and honest with you, like those novels you like to read in a cozy chair. Yes my pages are worn and my spine has creases, but I am still a great book that shouldn't be put down. I bought you a book for your birthday which you have not let me give you. I offered you a foot massage, to take you shooting, have lunch, fix your car, and you continually turn me away. The honest truth is that you have not met any of my requirements, because you haven't given me anything to write them down with.\\n\\nYour scars are more obvious than you believe...\\n\\nI am scarred and broken too, from birth when my fathered abandoned us, by fault of family members who didn't spare the rod, by trauma of civil war, and the drowning of my lineage's potential in an ocean of alcoholism. I am the only pottery piece which escaped total destruction from my families studio. But be fooled not for I have been dropped, broken, and glued back together haphazardly. Yet the years have filled me with love, understanding, patience, and a drive to make the space around me cheerful and bright. \\n\\nMy mind conjures up an image when I write this:\\n\\n\\\"A small stained glass window is deep set in white stucco as the morning sun has started to beam through. A stream of warm photons reaches an obviously broken and repaired vase painted with bright hues of varying colors. In the small vase are flowers which always make you smile. When you look upon this scene you feel comfy, cozy, and content. You register that the scene is exactly as it should be, everything just fits, even that obviously broken and repaired vase.\\\"\\n\\nSo you see, I recognize the scars left by other people who have handled you roughly. I see the trauma of hurtful words used as weapons against you, and the doubt which erodes your inner worth. I understand why you build your walls, why you don't recognize your value, embrace your confidence, and why you spook at loves touch. I would admire your imperfections if you would only let me see them. I cannot make your scars disappear, but you don't have to hide them from me for they are part of you and everything that makes you beautiful.\\n\\nThese are the last words I shall sow into this field, for I do not wish to destroy myself upon barren soil. I hope the light from a full pink moon helps these seeds grow. I pray the rain waters that come afterwards heal and nourish you. I hope you find the love and peace I can envision so clearly...\\n\\n\\\"Imagine yourself standing in the middle of a meadow overflowing with high grasses and wild flowers. A breeze flows through which makes the grasses and flowers sway like green seas. In the breeze you can pick out the scents of Tiger-Lilies, Lupine, and Queen-of-the-Prairie. Bees can be heard motoring in the distance, and choirs of birds sing acapella close by. You lift your face towards the sun and its photons fill you with warmth which seeps down into your core.\\\"\\n\\nThis princess... is the feeling I wish to blanket you in. But as I hold my arms out wide with a blanket awaiting, it is up to you to close the distance between us.\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-04-20T19:12:41.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Princess.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I write this to unburden my soul in the hopes that these words either open your eyes or release me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I came on strong...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, I ran towards your blazing 10-alarm fire instead of away.

I am an Aries, I am as transparent as a canary diamond, clear blue skies, or the sliding glass door we all run into in our youth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You are my passing infatuation...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You are my muse, my inspiration, most definitely not a passing infatuation. After some contemplation I have come to understand why you call yourself an infatuation. You describe yourself as a shiny object of momentary distraction... &amp;quot;and I picture a cat playing with a shiny tinkling bell.&amp;quot; The real truth is buried between your words, the words that you use to build walls and defend yourself. I am not infatuated, for that is an emotion for cats and small children. Infatuation does not inspire poems, art, music playlists, loss of sleep, and most of all a sense of longing. I have given you full access into the circus tent of my life for which I am the ring leader. Meanwhile you have used words, psychology, astrology, and anything else you could reach to build moats, traps, and obstacles. You are absolutely right... I know only the little bits you have chosen to show me, because you have chosen to show me so little.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You meet my requirements, and so I have fallen for you like a lost puppy dog...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This would be true if I was a lost, hungry, and exhausted puppy dog in need of rescue. But I am not, and at most you have patted my head and called me a good boy, but otherwise walked away. Recently I laid in sleepless contemplation while my thoughts played pong inside my skull. I realized that I have been absolutely open and honest with you, like those novels you like to read in a cozy chair. Yes my pages are worn and my spine has creases, but I am still a great book that shouldn&amp;#39;t be put down. I bought you a book for your birthday which you have not let me give you. I offered you a foot massage, to take you shooting, have lunch, fix your car, and you continually turn me away. The honest truth is that you have not met any of my requirements, because you haven&amp;#39;t given me anything to write them down with.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Your scars are more obvious than you believe...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am scarred and broken too, from birth when my fathered abandoned us, by fault of family members who didn&amp;#39;t spare the rod, by trauma of civil war, and the drowning of my lineage&amp;#39;s potential in an ocean of alcoholism. I am the only pottery piece which escaped total destruction from my families studio. But be fooled not for I have been dropped, broken, and glued back together haphazardly. Yet the years have filled me with love, understanding, patience, and a drive to make the space around me cheerful and bright. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My mind conjures up an image when I write this:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A small stained glass window is deep set in white stucco as the morning sun has started to beam through. A stream of warm photons reaches an obviously broken and repaired vase painted with bright hues of varying colors. In the small vase are flowers which always make you smile. When you look upon this scene you feel comfy, cozy, and content. You register that the scene is exactly as it should be, everything just fits, even that obviously broken and repaired vase.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So you see, I recognize the scars left by other people who have handled you roughly. I see the trauma of hurtful words used as weapons against you, and the doubt which erodes your inner worth. I understand why you build your walls, why you don&amp;#39;t recognize your value, embrace your confidence, and why you spook at loves touch. I would admire your imperfections if you would only let me see them. I cannot make your scars disappear, but you don&amp;#39;t have to hide them from me for they are part of you and everything that makes you beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;These are the last words I shall sow into this field, for I do not wish to destroy myself upon barren soil. I hope the light from a full pink moon helps these seeds grow. I pray the rain waters that come afterwards heal and nourish you. I hope you find the love and peace I can envision so clearly...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Imagine yourself standing in the middle of a meadow overflowing with high grasses and wild flowers. A breeze flows through which makes the grasses and flowers sway like green seas. In the breeze you can pick out the scents of Tiger-Lilies, Lupine, and Queen-of-the-Prairie. Bees can be heard motoring in the distance, and choirs of birds sing acapella close by. You lift your face towards the sun and its photons fill you with warmth which seeps down into your core.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This princess... is the feeling I wish to blanket you in. But as I hold my arms out wide with a blanket awaiting, it is up to you to close the distance between us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 2,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 8,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/12tbxod/splay_my_words_upon_this_soil_so_they_may_open/\",\n            \"username\": \"MadeByAlcoholics\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_12vqvno\": {\n            \"title\": \"Dear No_Potato_3740\",\n            \"body\": \"URL: /r/DiabolicOughts/comments/12vouq0/dear_no_potato_3740/\\n\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-04-23T01:33:30.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"URL: /r/DiabolicOughts/comments/12vouq0/dear_no_potato_3740/\\n\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 1,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/12vqvno/dear_no_potato_3740/\",\n            \"username\": \"DivineUnion_FKH8RS\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_13g00uk\": {\n            \"title\": \"4 days...???\",\n            \"body\": \"Dee, told me she's not coming...\\nIf she doesn't come then I have nothing but the plane ticket to get there.

If you had to make a decision on giving this another chance but all you are allowed to base that decision on, was the way it was when we were physically in each other's presence. Nothing else.

Is the stripped down version powerful enough to make you believe that what was there is worth fighting for? Do you believe what was there was something you will find again in this lifetime? Do you believe that things that are that powerful physically and somehow remain in existence when you are apart, are as disposable as any other relationship you have ever had? Or I have had? One to be ended by walking away without words or ended over social media and leaving to chance the same person was on the other end responding to you? Or is it something that even if there was a chance, any chance, you could have that magic back again, based only on your physical interaction in person with them, nothing else, what would you do?\\n\\nGo back to that day your air conditioner was broken. The day we met. The day that changed everything for both of us. I won't put your name on here. I never have. I don't write using your initials or sign with mine. You know how I always protected you in that way. I always asked you if it was ok to show your picture and if you said no, I wouldn't. I don't care if you have reason to believe otherwise. It's not true and it doesn't matter right now. I am trying to give enough clues so you know that this is me. But I left you something. I don't know if you have it yet or not. It is at it's destination. The note is short and doesn't say much. But every word of love and wanting you that I have written is for you. You don't have to question that. All of it is for you. Maybe a little note and a big box will lead you back to me. Because I still remember the day your air conditioner broke. And I know you do too. And I know we can make it and I know all of this will have been worth it. And if there is a next time, I want all or nothing at all. I don't want pieces of you. I want every piece of you.

I am not closing communication I am leaving it wide open. If you can't reach me, it's not rejection. It means there is some other reason or interference causing it. I don't care if you show up unannounced to my apartment anytime day or night. Even though that did not go over so well for me when I tried it. There are other people on here writing letters as me. I will prove who I am in the dm. It's a yes to everything you want here. The answer is yes. If you truly want me to let you go, I will say yes to that also. I don't want to think about that but, will you at least call me and tell me so I can hear the words come from you so that I know? But please don't call me and tell me that. I want to be yours. I want you to want me too. I want you to make my dreams come true. And I want to be everything to you. This is our story. We are connected.

One to be ended by walking away without words or ended over social media and leaving to chance the same person was on the other end responding to you? Or is it something that even if there was a chance, any chance, you could have that magic back again, based only on your physical interaction in person with them, nothing else, what would you do?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Go back to that day your air conditioner was broken. The day we met. The day that changed everything for both of us. I won&amp;#39;t put your name on here. I never have. I don&amp;#39;t write using your initials or sign with mine. You know how I always protected you in that way. I always asked you if it was ok to show your picture and if you said no, I wouldn&amp;#39;t. I don&amp;#39;t care if you have reason to believe otherwise. It&amp;#39;s not true and it doesn&amp;#39;t matter right now. I am trying to give enough clues so you know that this is me. But I left you something. I don&amp;#39;t know if you have it yet or not. It is at it&amp;#39;s destination. The note is short and doesn&amp;#39;t say much. But every word of love and wanting you that I have written is for you. You don&amp;#39;t have to question that. All of it is for you. Maybe a little note and a big box will lead you back to me. Because I still remember the day your air conditioner broke. And I know you do too. And I know we can make it and I know all of this will have been worth it. And if there is a next time, I want all or nothing at all. I don&amp;#39;t want pieces of you. I want every piece of you. Not to be able to say I won. To be able to say, that is my person. And for there to be no confusion in anyone&amp;#39;s mind, who that person is. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please dont try to find me through email, social media. My accounts have been compromised and so have yours. I am closing comments here but you can dm me. If my account on here disappears, it means it got shut down, or a shadow ban. I am not closing communication I am leaving it wide open. If you can&amp;#39;t reach me, it&amp;#39;s not rejection. It means there is some other reason or interference causing it. I don&amp;#39;t care if you show up unannounced to my apartment anytime day or night. Even though that did not go over so well for me when I tried it. There are other people on here writing letters as me. I will prove who I am in the dm. It&amp;#39;s a yes to everything you want here. The answer is yes. If you truly want me to let you go, I will say yes to that also. I don&amp;#39;t want to think about that but, will you at least call me and tell me so I can hear the words come from you so that I know? But please don&amp;#39;t call me and tell me that. I want to be yours. I want you to want me too. I want you to make my dreams come true. And I want to be everything to you. This is our story. We are connected. Because you are a part of me and I am a part of you. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hope to hear from you. I still miss the fuck out of you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-That 1 Capricorn earth sign who talks to Angels.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 9,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 8,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/12s9vfi/a_big_box_and_a_little_note/\",\n            \"username\": \"DivineUnion_FKH8RS\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_12r4bwb\": {\n            \"title\": \"Two Greek love myths-poetry\",\n            \"body\": \"URL: https://www.scribd.com/document/637246719/Apollo-and-Daphne-Elizabethan-sonnet-cycle-sequence-erotic-poetry\\n\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-04-18T21:04:09.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"URL: https://www.scribd.com/document/637246719/Apollo-and-Daphne-Elizabethan-sonnet-cycle-sequence-erotic-poetry\\n\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 3,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 3,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/12r4bwb/two_greek_love_mythspoetry/\",\n            \"username\": \"qiling\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_12pyjuv\": {\n            \"title\": \"My Storm\",\n            \"body\": \"And my storm rages on, without you there to weather it.\\n\\nIn the abyss left by the void of the absence of your soul, I roam.\\n\\nConjoined as I thought we'd be, were we merely a touch too far.

Her top drawer will be empty. It was once full of the little letters and poems you would leave for her around the house:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;\\u201cI\\u2019m walking down to get eggs. Back in 30. I will miss you like the flower misses the sun. Please don&amp;#39;t leave the bed\\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Je Ne T&amp;#39;oublierai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;\\u201cIt was terrible, I walked all around, but you weren&amp;#39;t there. It was the worst. They should really work on stocking you at the grocery store. I looked and I looked and I looked. It was horrible... but it&amp;#39;s OK now\\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t at first site, at least not for you. Pretty is priced at a dime a dozen. Beauty has levels, a depth that grows more enchanting the farther down it goes. The talking. It&amp;#39;s always been the talking for you, and it probably always will be. Both the playful, gentle words on a Sunday afternoon along with the long, slow conversations about hopes, fears, dreams, and regrets. Every sentence is just another way to say \\u201cThis is a piece of my heart. Please be careful with it. It&amp;#39;s very important to me.\\u201c  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She will have taken the pictures of you together, probably for the best. She was always smart like that. She will have left some mugs of her own that she knows you like, slivers of her. She will have left you all of the little sketches she would draw. That drawer will still be full.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You will wonder how we got from A to B. We were always romantic but never dramatic. Did she know she ran my show? Did she know that she never needed to tell me how high to jump? I just would have tried for the moon every time.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Part of you pulses and beats outside of you. You will (hopefully) wonder not with the idiocy of a sitcom father but with the genuine confusion, care, and worry that you did wrong by someone who owns a piece of you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;\\u201cChe Gane?\\u201d as the people of Central Asia would say. Pick up the rubble. You will watch the balcony wind sweep through your prayer flags. Did I forget to plug them in? Maybe they\\u2019re not facing the right way. Could be getting a shitty signal. Is Mercury in retrograde?  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You will take a walk and review game tape. Was I strong enough? Was I sweet enough? Did I listen enough? In every other restaurant or store, there will be wonderful memories.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew I shouldn\\u2019t have picked a Malbec. No, she likes a dry red.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I knew I shouldn\\u2019t have worn that tie. No, she loved that tie. She picked it out. She used to grab me by it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What was I thinking? I knew I shouldn\\u2019t have sat on that side of the table. I knew we should have gotten a booth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Did we go on vacation enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You will look for answers where there are quite possibly none to be found.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You will live in a haunted house. You will think about her staring at you from her spot on the couch. Her eyes bright and wild as any jungle cat but holding a soft smile, like she somehow managed to put a collar on a jaguar. The happy dreams will be far more painful than the few sad ones.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You will go to lunch with friends. They used to smile the moment she\\u2019d leave the table, telling you they didn\\u2019t know you could relax like that. You used to turn into jello and soften the moment she came in, and you loved how she\\u2019d light up when you moseyed on over.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There will be no \\u201cfuck her\\u201d no, \\u201cyou can do better\\u201d, no \\u201cI didn\\u2019t like her anyways\\u201d, because they saw you together, kicking in the front door like movie stars. Everyone will express a quiet sorrow, but not because you are sad. It just doesn\\u2019t feel right. A cosmic injustice. An affront to whatever gods may walk the stars.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You will have never felt so right and have it matter so little. Be a man. It\\u2019s not your first rodeo.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;\\u201c&lt;em&gt;We heal stronger in the places that are broken\\u201d - Ernest Hemingway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You\\u2019ll walk the city and pass by familiar park benches. A little exposure therapy couldn\\u2019t hurt. It was here. It was right here. She was right here. She kissed my fingers and happy-cried. Forever means forever. \\u201cJe ne t&amp;#39;oublierai\\u201d. She kept the letters because she wants to read them. She wants to read them forever...  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She said the same about you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fuck.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You will plan trips. Maybe it\\u2019s time to dust off the old tent and go camping. You will pick through your passport, pondering over various stamps. You will laugh when you catch yourself Googling the weather in Kyiv, wondering how the Ukrainian Foreign Legion is looking this time of year. You will still lift and run and hit the pads, but there will be no rage to exorcise. That even makes it worse. There is no prescription for this.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You will have more than one dark night of the soul when you find hairs in your car, in the bed, in the kitchen, in the shower. They&amp;#39;re all too long to call your own.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I could call her sister.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She likes me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Just to make sure she\\u2019s ok.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Stop.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We\\u2019ve got hockey tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It\\u2019s not your first rodeo.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 2,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 0.83,\n            \"upVotes\": 7,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/12j3xto/drawer_space/\",\n            \"username\": \"spq09fsu\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_12j8q1q\": {\n            \"title\": \"Cold-COVID February\",\n            \"body\": \"I think about that cold-COVID February night and how the breeze would send shivers down my spine, \\n\\nAs I slept on a park bench while I had no home, \\n\\nI wept at the moon with all the \\nstars looking down, \\n\\nAnd pleaded at the morning sun to give me bountiful security that I so prayed for, eventually it did.\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-04-12T03:41:12.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think about that cold-COVID February night and how the breeze would send shivers down my spine, &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I slept on a park bench while I had no home, &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wept at the moon with all the \\nstars looking down, &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And pleaded at the morning sun to give me bountiful security that I so prayed for, eventually it did.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 1,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 0.84,\n            \"upVotes\": 4,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/12j8q1q/coldcovid_february/\",\n            \"username\": \"Plane_Form5131\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_12j99r9\": {\n            \"title\": \"Don\\u2019t Be Afraid Of The Dark:\",\n            \"body\": \"I hate to say I love the stars \\nYou can get lost in the ever expanding eyes, that sees more, I can almost touch them just by looking at them.  \\nAnd I hate to say I\\u2019m afraid of the dark\\nThe way it looked past midnight,\\nSo terror can creep through the dark\\nLooking at the moonlight , would it send me across the stars?

That was like 1 month ago I think. I want her back but I'm mature enough to let her go If she dosent feel the same way. I want to send her this letter in hopes that she's able to see my feelings and understand my love for her. To anyone who reads this my question is should I send this or no?\\nDear Blank\\n\\n I know I haven't been the most perfect person in the world or the most perfect boyfriend. I've made plenty of mistakes in life and in our relationship that I'll never forget and never let go of you mean the absolute world to me and every moment with you is a moment of magic that's worth more than gold. I'll probably keep making mistakes in life financial mistakes, mental mistakes and maybe even car and home mistakes. But the one mistakes I'll ever make again is taking you and your love for granted your such a kind and beautiful soul. I love you from the inside and the outside. I've never felt so infatuated and so happy to be around someone other than when I'm with you. I really value everything you've done for me and all the times you've guided me into a better tomorrow. I love the little things as much as the big things. I loved when you would sit on my lap when we would be outside or inside and we would have a good intimate time with each other like when we would be at your most house and have sleepovers and that one time when we're outside the park near your moms house and you say in my lap while we smoked weed. I also loved and missed sleeping Over your grandma's house and cuddling with you and Watching movies with you while we eat junk food or even healthy food lol it always felt like thanks giving while we were there.  I loved when you would have sinus infections and i would help massage your head snd your nasal canal until you feel better, I loved when you would take off my glasses for me when I would be sleeping I really fucking appreciated that. I love when you would just hug me and hold me , when you would put your head  on my chest and just lay there until you go to sleep and then I would just caress your face and your head, and even your back and you would keep waking up and I would keep caressing you back to sleep. Just little things like that were like pieces of heaven for me. You were like sent from heaven and I lost you before I could cenemt how heavenly you were in your eyes. I really wanted to marry you and travel every part of the world with you. I wanted to go to Alsaska and see the borealis lights with you. Live in a cabin for a bit, take you to see under water sea creatures, take you to interactive zoos, I wanted to go to private islands with you and explore every part of it as a new adventure everyday, I wanted to see everything with you. Everything under the sun and under the moon that I could see. I wanted to live anywhere that you picked everytime you would mention moving to Miami I'll tell you I'll see because I wanted to surprise you and give you the most beautiful home on the market but I guess I should've been more clear since you probably thought I meant  no. The last time we talked about getting married and I talked about getting a backyard big enough for it you were so excited and I loved that, I loved hearing you talk about your future plans and your goals. How you had your wedding already planned and how much you loved animals and how you had the idea of running a nursery it would sound a little crazy at times bc of all upkeep and disposing of animal feces but any endeavor with you is worth while since we're going to be learning as we go and every new day would be an amazing learning experience. I really wanted to start a family with you and have kids, I know that kid would've  came out as beautiful and as kind as you and it would've been a real privilege and honor to have been the father of your kids. But I really wanted to enjoy life with you and do everything we could before having kids so you won't feel like you lost a part of your life that you could've enjoyed before having kids. I know how much of a physical and mental burden having kids is. There's the unimaginable pain of giving birth and holding a baby in your uterus for months that feel like it'll never end, then there's even times that the baby could die and I would've hated if that were to have happened to you, but if it did I would've been there every step of the way. Then there's also post partum depression and how intensely it affect some mothers and I don't ever want you to feel alone and like your losing your mind, If given the opportunity to have kids with you I will pamper and spoil the fuck out of you everyday would be like your own holiday and you wouldn't have to worry about working or taking care of the kid when your tired. Life really sucks and I just wanted to make it as easy as possible as I could for you. Then there was your PCOS that makes it hard to survive to get pregnant but not impossible and I just wanted to meal prep you so many healthy foods and help you do workouts that can help almost cure your pcos because that's how much you mean to me, I've always put your needs and health at the highest priority. You made me feel alive and full of love and here I am months after our breakup and I'm striving for greatness for myself and I'm making plans for the future bit it just sucks that I'm getting all theses plans and all this success and I can't share it with the one person in the world who means the world to me. Every time I share what I have with you and what I've accomplished it makes me so happy, idk I've always felt this strong connection with you and I could never stay mad at you. I've talked to so many woman and none of them come close to being anything like, not even close. To me talking to you and spending time with you was always peaceful and sensational I know there were times when we argued and we were mad at each other at things in the past and like you said you had ptsd from our relationship one time I also had it as well from all the times that we would have falling out from things that would happen that wasant my fault and there were also times that I was giving my all to you and you kept telling me you weren't ready but then when I would give you space you would come back just to leave and you did it multiple times and that shit was really traumatizing for me I know you never saw it that way but to me it was really traumatizing and painful. You made plenty of mistakes as well and as painful as they were I forgive you and I want nothing more than for you to be in my life so I can cherish you everyday like the beautiful flower you are. I know you picked someone else over me and yea it hurts but I understand fully. You were beyond hurt and you found someone that can give you some happiness without any negative baggage and that's beautiful  and its perfectly fine , the reason we're alive is to pursue happiness even if it's a false sense of happiness. I just wish things were different and I was able to send you this and your able to see the kind of love that I have for you. I love you and I wish you nothing but the best in life even if its not with me. I just wished It was easy to stop loving you so my mind can stop torturing me. I know last time we talked I said I wasant into you anymore and I really did believe it, but I've just been instinctively been bottling up my emotions and feelings and it's a nice coping mechanism to a certain extent since I won't be able to have you on my mind as much and I can just ignore those feelings. It gets kind of helpful until I can't bottle up my emotion and I just kind of explode and at that point it becomes a horrible mechanism. What I've learned from it is that  i'm not as over you as I thought I was. I still have feelings for you and I still love you. I know this isn't what you wanted to hear and I don't care if it doesn't change anything I just wanted to get this off my chest and just finally let it go. Your an amazing woman and and the best bestfriend I could have ever asked for. I'm really close to my goal of getting a house and a car and the dog that I wanted and I just wished I could've showed you and shared these things with you. There's an endless amount of things that I can say about you through my admiration for you and I have an endless amount of love for you, but I don't want to make this any longer than what it is and I dont want to take up to much of your time.\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-04-07T04:36:38.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My ex and I broke up in the middle of December of last year and she got into a rebound relationship pretty quickly saying that that the guy makes her happy, we talked for a bit after she told me that and after she came to be about something personal but ultimately she decided to end it since she didint want to disrespect her relationship.

I still remember all of the amazing memories and experiences we had together, the way you looked at me that just told me he\\u2019s my person\\u2014my soulmate the one I wanted to keep growing with forever. I always said it was kismet from the moment we met. Yes, our journey was riddled with obstacles with my brain injury and PTSD\\u2014 but life is never easy. You were there for me at the worst time in my life that I ever endured and for that I will always be grateful to you. You don\\u2019t know how many days and nights I was just trying to be strong and \\u201cbe normal\\u201d. When I was literally terrified and scared a lot of the time. You made me feel safe, you helped me brave the world again with your light. Honestly I know I would not have survived this without your kindness, patience, love, and so so much support. I was very angry with you towards the end though, to be honest. I was so fucking mad at you. I was blaming you for not being able to \\u201cshow up\\u201d for me. I realized that I missed so many signs and moments that would have told me you were over me. You just kept reassuring me how much you loved me and you would always be there for me.

It was real for me though and this ending completely crushed my spirit that you helped me get back to, that part me that was left to survive anyway. I was just yearning and clinging and trying to hold on so hard just to keep our dead love alive. It was good that you buried it and you decided to become a ghost. I know I have said many things to you about the ways I felt, I don\\u2019t even know if you ever really heard me. You hurt me so deep my heart literally shattered with those horrible last words\\u2014 \\u201cI think that you love me more than I love you\\u201d and all I constantly wonder is how long did I mean that little to you? Why did you continue to treat me like I didn\\u2019t matter knowing that you were saying the words \\u201cI love you\\u201d but truly incapable of projecting the actual meaning of love? I felt it and the sad part is I said that to you\\u2014 I really tried to give you your space. I also asked you if we should end this amicably with love still so we could part as friends. You were too stubborn to let me go then I guess and just kept on reassuring me of your love and everything was fine. I should have trusted my instincts, you taught me to never dismiss them, so thanks for that! You know, we ended up saying the worst things when we were hurting. And we both were hurting in different ways emotionally. You being SO non-confrontational and unable to communicate wanting out\\u2014 I wasn\\u2019t what you wanted anymore. Then me just desperately wanting to keep your love so much I lost myself in the process. Not that I wasn\\u2019t lost with my brain injury and learning to be a new person when I barely even remembered myself.

We were tired of those same endless fights, weren\\u2019t we? I think so\\u2026. right? I think closure is all I truly wanted from you because I just couldn\\u2019t understand and still don\\u2019t\\u2014 I desperately needed the blatant truth once and for all. I don\\u2019t want it from you anymore though. I am just here pouring my heart out. This is my closure whether you know it or not is not my problem because it\\u2019s only for me. You don\\u2019t exist anymore\\u2014 but that\\u2019s what you chose to do to me because I was not worth it to you or for you. I will always be ashamed that I could not tell because I was too blinded by false love in the ending to see it was already gone. I trusted you, I trusted your words to me, yet they were all lies in the end. For what?!?! Unfortunately it took me this long to realize that. Do you even know when things got bad? Because I do\\u2026. it was when your words were no longer matching your actions. You started to make me feel disrespected and you stopped communicating with me. I went to bed, feeling unappreciated and worthless as I laid there alone. Or sitting in the living room alone waiting for you to come home from work with a homemade dinner waiting. I thought this was not a big enough a reason to leave\\u2014 I didn\\u2019t know the ways you would keep letting me down slowly breaking my heart to pieces. You always made your choice, I hope you remember that. Then when I finally left we still agreed to try to work it out and you were going to do the work to and get therapy. Always giving me words of affirmation, a future with us written in the stars\\u2014 destiny; kismet. Until that last night I would ever see or speak to you in the end of September when you told me you met HER one night in Chicago\\u2026. after we sat laughing and reminiscing eating sushi for dinner. Those kisses still lingering in my memory and on my lips. All the tears and laughter that night fixing my guitar, me trying to be respectful of you moving on but still desperately wishing I was enough. You laying in my lap crying while I ran my fingers through your hair telling you I\\u2019d be okay\\u2026. knowing in my heart that\\u2019s not what I wanted at all. I wanted us back, I wanted the days and nights back when you couldn\\u2019t wait to be by my side. I wanted the man that always cared about my feelings and wanted to be there for me. Respect and communication are what keeps a relationship alive after the initial spark. It keeps suffocating you, that burn in your heart when you fight to be treated with respect. You did not respect me, you did not value me. For you, it was no issue. And for me, it was everything. That's where we started to grow apart. I will never have regrets about this decision anymore. It was critical for me to keep what was left of my dignity intact. I wish you all the happiness and love in the world. However, I hope that we don\\u2019t cross paths again, ever. I no longer want to keep in touch, it would always be one-sided anyway. I want us to just live peacefully and very much apart from each other.

It will make me softer and more responsible, so much more stable. But for now, even I would never admit it, without you, I would be lost. This might not be enough. There's so much other's achieve, is this really all there is for me? But I don't really mean that, I know those things don't matter. It's the small narcissistic moment I have sometimes, but who doesn't? You me, our life, at the end of our days I know I will lean back, my dog and me coming back from our long solitary walks, home to you, talk about the kids, lean back and know we had a good life, you and me.

When I stop being scared of the others.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It will heal the pain that makes me explode like a toddler. It will make me softer and more responsible, so much more stable. But for now, even I would never admit it, without you, I would be lost. This might not be enough. There&amp;#39;s so much other&amp;#39;s achieve, is this really all there is for me? But I don&amp;#39;t really mean that, I know those things don&amp;#39;t matter. It&amp;#39;s the small narcissistic moment I have sometimes, but who doesn&amp;#39;t? You me, our life, at the end of our days I know I will lean back, my dog and me coming back from our long solitary walks, home to you, talk about the kids, lean back and know we had a good life, you and me. But now, I&amp;#39;m not that strong, that I&amp;#39;m not alone, that you hold my hand, I need that more than I admit. I will be. I will understand all this and I will find what I&amp;#39;m missing, my task or realize that I&amp;#39;d found it all along. But I&amp;#39;m smart enough to know that you, our kids, are a big part of that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;\\ud83c\\udf08\\ud83d\\udc9c\\ud83d\\udc9a    \\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc9b\\ud83d\\udc97\\ud83d\\ude0b\\ud83d\\ude36\\u200d\\ud83c\\udf2b\\ufe0f\\ud83e\\udd2a\\u2764\\ufe0f\\ud83d\\udc76&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 3,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/11pmz5s/thank_you/\",\n            \"username\": \"[deleted]\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_11q8u0c\": {\n            \"title\": \"More Human Than Human\",\n            \"body\": \"More Human Than Human,\\n\\nMr. Sour Potato, says I might want to have a beer n blunt with you.

I just know that I need to get this off my chest if I want to move forward, I am also not at all asking for a relationship, as I know that it would probably not be healthy for me right now. I will, and already do, respect any way that you might feel about what I\\u2019m going to explain. If you need space from me then please, please, please, just let me know. Heck, you don\\u2019t even need too if you don\\u2019t feel comfortable doing so. Just avoid me if you\\u2019d like, do whatever is most comfortable for you.\\n\\n      In all honesty, me telling you this comes across as very selfish. I\\u2019ll probably regret it.\\n\\n       You are bubbly and upbeat, yet never fail to show immense emotional strength and stability. When I\\u2019m near you, I am the happiest. You make what would usually be a drag for me exciting and new. Even when you hurt me, it\\u2019s almost a good pain. It\\u2019s pain worth suffering through. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s healthy at all, it probably isn\\u2019t. \\n\\n       The truth is, I care about you quite a lot and am willing to put up with just about anything if it means that I get to spend time with you. \\n\\n       I just ask that you try your best to understand this. You bring fun into everything we do together, and I want to thank you. You stick to your morals and are persistent, you never give up on what you believe in. I know that me saying this probably sounds pretty awkward, but you are truly an incredible person. I have never, ever, met anybody that made me happier then you do\\n\\n      Frequently, I find myself worrying that I might be failing as a friend; to make you laugh, smile, and maybe even open up to me. I have no obligation to be your friend, nor do you have one to be mine, but from my perspective you and your feelings are very important to me. Maybe it\\u2019s all in my head. After all, I am taking a vague emotion of yours as an immediate reassurance, when really it means nothing. I shouldn\\u2019t care so much about what you think. Maybe I am just overreacting, I don\\u2019t know anymore. We\\u2019re only friends after all. I have lost so many friends in the past, hurting both them and myself. I\\u2019m not sure if you talk to me because you want to, or if it\\u2019s just out of pity because I seem lonely. Whatever the case is, I know that you are an incredibly kind person and would never try to hurt me, but subconsciously I am taking your behaviours and flipping it around in a way that makes me feel like I\\u2019m failing as a friend. When you are happy and positive towards me, I assume that I am succeeding. When I make a mistake or don\\u2019t immediately make you happy, for some reason I take it as a bad thing. I really can\\u2019t deal with friendship, even though being alone is the most agonizing thing for me. All of this is really selfish of me. Don\\u2019t take it personally, it\\u2019s not your fault at all. It\\u2019s my problem, I just needed to voice it really badly. I couldn\\u2019t stand to lose you, and I keep telling myself that I am; even while I logically know that it doesn\\u2019t make any sense at all. I just want to know if our friendship is valuable to you, and if it is as important to you as I hope it is, I wish that I could only show you how much it means to me. I would do anything to get to spend more time around you, but I believe that you think that I want space from you. Verbally communicating emotions is really hard for me, if you haven\\u2019t noticed. I watch you grow closer with all of your other friends, it hurts to watch. Makes me realize how behind I am. It brings my problems into light. Aside from all of this, it doesn\\u2019t help that I am starting to find that I might want to get to know you as a little bit more then a friend.\\n\\n       But in those moments when I feel like I am making you happy and seeing you laugh, I get the most incredible feeling. I get the feeling that maybe I\\u2019m not failing as bad as I thought before. It\\u2019s similar to the feeling of infatuation, but it is more a feeling of belonging rather then desire. I guess that by telling you this, I\\u2019m asking you to reassure me.\\n\\n       I had to push myself hard to tell you this, seeing as our friendship might not be worth as much to you, as it does to me. I\\u2019m sure you would be very surprised at just how lonely I would be if you weren\\u2019t here. I\\u2019ve lost all of my friends so many time, I hope this doesn\\u2019t sounds desperate, but I can\\u2019t stand the idea of losing you as well.\\n \\n       The most upsetting part is that I know that this feeling most likely won\\u2019t be mutual. I feel like I betrayed you as a friend.\\n\\n       I\\u2019m so sorry if I damaged our friendship, yet even if I did, I will still be glad that I told you nonetheless. Telling you this was something that I had to do in order to move on, whether we stay friend or not. I really do want to stay friends though.\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-03-11T18:47:39.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Before I get to the point I just want to let you know that this is not question; nor do you owe me anything whatsoever. I just know that I need to get this off my chest if I want to move forward, I am also not at all asking for a relationship, as I know that it would probably not be healthy for me right now. I will, and already do, respect any way that you might feel about what I\\u2019m going to explain. If you need space from me then please, please, please, just let me know. Heck, you don\\u2019t even need too if you don\\u2019t feel comfortable doing so. Just avoid me if you\\u2019d like, do whatever is most comfortable for you.\\n\\n  In all honesty, me telling you this comes across as very selfish. I\\u2019ll probably regret it.\\n\\n   You are bubbly and upbeat, yet never fail to show immense emotional strength and stability. When I\\u2019m near you, I am the happiest. You make what would usually be a drag for me exciting and new. Even when you hurt me, it\\u2019s almost a good pain. It\\u2019s pain worth suffering through. I\\u2019m not sure if it\\u2019s healthy at all, it probably isn\\u2019t. \\n\\n   The truth is, I care about you quite a lot and am willing to put up with just about anything if it means that I get to spend time with you. \\n\\n   I just ask that you try your best to understand this. You bring fun into everything we do together, and I want to thank you. You stick to your morals and are persistent, you never give up on what you believe in. I know that me saying this probably sounds pretty awkward, but you are truly an incredible person. I have never, ever, met anybody that made me happier then you do\\n\\n  Frequently, I find myself worrying that I might be failing as a friend; to make you laugh, smile, and maybe even open up to me. I have no obligation to be your friend, nor do you have one to be mine, but from my perspective you and your feelings are very important to me. Maybe it\\u2019s all in my head. After all, I am taking a vague emotion of yours as an immediate reassurance, when really it means nothing. I shouldn\\u2019t care so much about what you think. Maybe I am just overreacting, I don\\u2019t know anymore. We\\u2019re only friends after all. I have lost so many friends in the past, hurting both them and myself. I\\u2019m not sure if you talk to me because you want to, or if it\\u2019s just out of pity because I seem lonely. Whatever the case is, I know that you are an incredibly kind person and would never try to hurt me, but subconsciously I am taking your behaviours and flipping it around in a way that makes me feel like I\\u2019m failing as a friend. When you are happy and positive towards me, I assume that I am succeeding. When I make a mistake or don\\u2019t immediately make you happy, for some reason I take it as a bad thing.

Wishing the pain throughout my body from the leukemia would cease. I find a way to smile, joke, grin ear to ear through the pain.

Over the years I have been stalked, harassed, threatened, and even kidnapped by past dates, lovers, or friends. All in hopes to keep me near. \\nI feel like a zoo animal. Fun to observe. Interesting to others. I'm aware I'm seen. I even tend to pine after attention just for the high of their laughs. \\nAfter the zoo has closed and I'm alone, my thoughts return. It's hard to sleep. The nightmares plague me relentlessly. The way I was caged as a child. Hung, beaten, burned, sexually assaulted. I escaped as a teen. Wondered the harshest streets. The only thing that kept me alive was hate and anger. I remember the first time having a gun to my face. I was scared. I trembled. The third time, I grabbed the barrel. Pulled it to my forehead, looking him in the eyes. I begged him. Please fucking pull it! Pull the fucking trigger! He ran away calling me the crazy one. I didn't feel relieved. I was mad he was a coward. \\nEven angrier that I had to live on. \\nSo many people have tried to take me in. Even as a youth. They try to show me love. Show me what is considered some type of normalcy. Until they figure out I am a wild animal that cannot be tame. \\nI have been the one who has bitten the hand that feeds me, time and time again.\\nIt wasn't until I had children of my own that changed me. I learned patience. I learned what true love really was. I was fearful they had to live in a world that I only knew as evil. I raised them to be free thinkers. Protected them. Loved them. Today they are nothing like me and I couldn't be prouder of the job I've done. \\nTwo of my children are biological. The rest I've brought in are young adults who've aged out of foster care. Youth eho have been displaced from their own homes for being LQBTQ+. \\nWhen homeless as a teen. I would walk through the middle class and rich neighborhoods. Observing the people. A guy fixing things in an open garage. Families setting the table. Kids riding on bikes. The smell of a grill cooking. The sound of a lawn being freshly mowed. Wishing I was like them. Wishing I had a safe place to rest. With both eyes closed. \\nI have helped over 25 kids over the past 12 years. So that they didn't have to feel as I once did. Trying to pay back the Karma wheel for all the bad I did after my escape. Taking what I felt the world owed me. I was selfish. \\nI had dated and tried my hand at relationships. Toxic attracted toxic. They never lasted long. I thought I had loved and lossed. It wasn't until recent that I had truly loved. I called him sunshine. I'm allergic to the sun. A sensitivity from being locked in a basement room until my escape. Many years. Parts of me feel as if I didn't escape. That I died down there. That I'm living through some sort of hellish pergatory. He was different. He was like me. I felt it the moment my eyes met his. Our breakup was his fault. I wasn't always at my best. I couldn't handle not being loved completely by him. I know he deserved a better me. Yet, I also deserved not to be cheated on. He broke me. Cut my heart to pieces and threw me out like trash. I'm broken. \\nI wonder why I can easily mend others but not myself. I let this disease take me over instead of fighting. I have no fight left in me. I'm tired. I'm ready to sleep. The deep sleep. To finally be at rest. To return to the cosmos and be stardust. I want my inner light to burn peacefully. To guide the broken from above. \\nI was going to post a last letter to him. I decided to write you. Someone I don't know instead. I had a friend set up a last face to face with him. So I could see him one last time. I walked away teary eyed. He seemed good. Happy. I knew then that I again was not wanted, nor needed. He told my friend after I left that it was the closure he needed. So I let it be just that. Closure. Who am I to disrupt the heart of the one, who was the one for me. I left knowing, I needed to let him go. The heart may want what it wants, but it may not deserve it. \\nSo, here I am. Putting my own final wishes in place. Making sure I've dotted the I's, and crossed my T's. \\nEnsuring that my last days are spent tying up loose ends. \\nI can't escape myself. The things in my head. Running away physically never helped the damage that was instilled and indoctrinated from the time I was born. I hate myself. \\nAlways searching for a partner in crime. The one who I can be my real self with. The one who would love me regardless of the ugly truth I bare. Someone who doesn't think I'm crazy for thinking *Natural Born Killers* is the most romantic movie ever made. \\nSeems unlikely to me. \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83d\\ude05 Thanks for caring. \\n\\nLove, \\nBonnie\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-02-22T18:52:33.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m here.

I learned patience. I learned what true love really was. I was fearful they had to live in a world that I only knew as evil. I raised them to be free thinkers. Protected them. Loved them. Today they are nothing like me and I couldn&amp;#39;t be prouder of the job I&amp;#39;ve done. \\nTwo of my children are biological. The rest I&amp;#39;ve brought in are young adults who&amp;#39;ve aged out of foster care. Youth eho have been displaced from their own homes for being LQBTQ+. \\nWhen homeless as a teen. I would walk through the middle class and rich neighborhoods. Observing the people. A guy fixing things in an open garage. Families setting the table. Kids riding on bikes. The smell of a grill cooking. The sound of a lawn being freshly mowed. Wishing I was like them. Wishing I had a safe place to rest. With both eyes closed. \\nI have helped over 25 kids over the past 12 years. So that they didn&amp;#39;t have to feel as I once did. Trying to pay back the Karma wheel for all the bad I did after my escape. Taking what I felt the world owed me. I was selfish. \\nI had dated and tried my hand at relationships. Toxic attracted toxic. They never lasted long. I thought I had loved and lossed. It wasn&amp;#39;t until recent that I had truly loved. I called him sunshine. I&amp;#39;m allergic to the sun. A sensitivity from being locked in a basement room until my escape. Many years. Parts of me feel as if I didn&amp;#39;t escape. That I died down there. That I&amp;#39;m living through some sort of hellish pergatory. He was different. He was like me. I felt it the moment my eyes met his. Our breakup was his fault. I wasn&amp;#39;t always at my best. I couldn&amp;#39;t handle not being loved completely by him. I know he deserved a better me. Yet, I also deserved not to be cheated on. He broke me. Cut my heart to pieces and threw me out like trash. I&amp;#39;m broken. \\nI wonder why I can easily mend others but not myself. I let this disease take me over instead of fighting. I have no fight left in me. I&amp;#39;m tired. I&amp;#39;m ready to sleep. The deep sleep. To finally be at rest. To return to the cosmos and be stardust. I want my inner light to burn peacefully. To guide the broken from above. \\nI was going to post a last letter to him. I decided to write you. Someone I don&amp;#39;t know instead. I had a friend set up a last face to face with him. So I could see him one last time. I walked away teary eyed. He seemed good. Happy. I knew then that I again was not wanted, nor needed. He told my friend after I left that it was the closure he needed. So I let it be just that. Closure. Who am I to disrupt the heart of the one, who was the one for me. I left knowing, I needed to let him go. The heart may want what it wants, but it may not deserve it. \\nSo, here I am. Putting my own final wishes in place. Making sure I&amp;#39;ve dotted the I&amp;#39;s, and crossed my T&amp;#39;s. \\nEnsuring that my last days are spent tying up loose ends. \\nI can&amp;#39;t escape myself. The things in my head. Running away physically never helped the damage that was instilled and indoctrinated from the time I was born. I hate myself. \\nAlways searching for a partner in crime. The one who I can be my real self with. The one who would love me regardless of the ugly truth I bare. Someone who doesn&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m crazy for thinking &lt;em&gt;Natural Born Killers&lt;/em&gt; is the most romantic movie ever made. \\nSeems unlikely to me. \\ud83e\\udd37\\ud83d\\ude05 Thanks for caring. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Love, \\nBonnie&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 16,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 5,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1197t04/clyde/\",\n            \"username\": \"Lil_RedWritingHood\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_11ae9w4\": {\n            \"title\": \"Bonnie Take On Me\",\n            \"body\": \"Bonnie,\\u00a0\\n\\n\\u00a0Did I disappoint you?

I received a book called \\\"God Winks on Love\\\" Let the Power of Coincidence Lead You To Love, by; Squire Rushnell... My coworker is very touched by my encounter with her in life. We met at work of all places and she has helped me in many ways because of our conversations about life, death and God. \\n\\nAnother coworker tells me about the chapters she reads in the Bible every morning, i make sure to ask her every day we prep together in the kitchen. I love her wisdom and the stories she tells with her sassy attitude make it even more entertaining. It brings the Bible ALIVE to me. I love working with my family. I found a place I belong, everyone really does care about working together and helping each other. We check on each other outside of work. I've never had that before, not even when I was a teacher.... People are very secluded at work. Then my retail job, I feel like I live there! Everyone I worked with for 6 years now. We are family too! I've had many conversations about God with many teenagers that take a seasonal job with us and then leave for college. \\n\\n6 Years now.... It feels like yesterday when I met everyone and the memories we've shared together. I never thought with very mundane jobs, I've learned the most about life and how to enjoy the small moments. The small interactions with people do make a difference. Especially can change the outcome of someone's whole day, depending on how you both treat each other or how you speak towards them in a welcoming tone of voice....\\n\\nWhen I'm tired, I'm guilty of not trying hard enough. But I do catch myself more often changing how I approach a person or situation. I can also help change someone from being upset to calm by asking casual questions or making a joke. I tend to have customers tell me about their personal life... I know I'm not the only cashier that may say that, but I really have noticed, even when I'm putting stuff away and trying to avoid customers asking me dumb questions. They find me in a far corner and still ask me \\\"DO YOU WORK HERE?!?\\\" \\n\\nI hate it so much!!!!!! Argh.... Yeah, duh, I work here, or I wouldn't be doing this.... I never say that, but I think it in my head and that causes me to not have a very nice response back to them. I sound annoyed and I've caught that too! lol..... Hey! DON'T JUDGE! XD\\n\\nWell, I look back at all of this and realized that what we say and how we say things really DO MATTER! Like when I taught my students in music each class, we had to go over our classroom expectations. One of them was \\\"THUMPER\\\" from Bambi.... \\n\\n\\\"If you can't say something nice, Don't say nothing at all.\\\"\\n\\nWell, dreams can come true in places you least expect it. I told Phil, I want a job that I can sustain myself, work together with others and enjoy what I do. I wake up, I look forward to what I do and I know I am touching other people's lives at the same time. Because, each interaction I have with someone, every conversation is something rich and resourceful to my growth. My inner child is LETTING GO of my past. My TRUAMA is releasing and I can't stop dancing around at work.... I annoy everyone around me. They sometimes ask me to stop singing, but I have so much LOVE FOR GOD inside of me. I can't hold it in. I'm so HAPPY! I have a few people in my past that are trying to stop me from accomplishing my goals and sharing my gifts, my intuitive gifts. That I can \\\"automatic write\\\" and connect to the other side.... I know this and I'm not afraid to speak out and share my truth with the world.\\n\\nI fell in love with someone that wore a mask when he was with me. He told me things and false promises to string me along. I was wrong in my shortcoming within this relationship and I never thought I had enough time to even start to prove myself to him, that I loved him. He broke it off with me before I even had the chance..... I'm so regretful, but I've been told by my intuition and Suz before I ever met this man, how I was going to meet him and also lose contact with him.\\n\\nShe told me in confidence when he said in a text message,\\n\\n\\\"It is what it is\\\"\\n\\nHe just left me in the cold. Confused to all hell, why he can't even talk in person or tell me why. He just changed his mind. Suz looked further into his life and that he is keeping a secret from me that he had a previous family and he is also bisexual.... This woman he is with is practicing witchcraft with him and they were trying to do something.... There is also a baby involved, but that was it and he has a dark side to him.\\n\\nWell, this man also said he had something dark about him and will take a secret with him to his grave. There was a boy in his life he told me wasn't his child. His mother also immediaetley became friends with me on FB and I saw that we share the same birthday... The more I dated this man, the more she changed her profile picture and colored her hair to be brunette. She still didn't want me to be around this child, and I just thought it was even weirder that this guy kept a room full of pictures of this baby from ultrasound, going on vacation together to Disney land from floor to ceiling. This woman who tells me she is looking out for him as a friend and doesn't want to see him hurt.... Why did accept her invitation? \\n\\nI never felt normal when I was around this guy, there was something about them.... I never could put a finger on it. \\n\\nI've been told to practice tarot intuitively. I went to a shop and learned protection spells and letting go of the past journaling techniques. I'm becoming more intuitive because I'm doing this. I've been told by Phil, that I was a very spiritual person in a past life or even a healer.... \\n\\nWell, my gifts are coming to fruition. I have plenty of people witness what I can do.  I love myself so unconditionally, that I am becoming aware of information that I never knew I could grasp.... I'm finding youtube videos that explain my life with this man to the very detail....\\n\\nWhy was I led to watch it randomly, when it never interested me before?\\n\\nWhy when I practice and watch a video, the same cards fly out of my deck? Why do they speak of Me being a Sag and him being a Taurus connected to another Sag?!?! H's... Mom!?\\n\\nWhy is this about twin flame and a taurus/sag practicing magick to keep me from finding my real DM?\\n\\nWhy is this man invading my dreams, thoughts, every day life, synchronicities are annoying. I am taking pictures and videos of everything!!!! I have proof!!!!!\\n\\nI'm in a loving form, and I'm doing what I love right now. I'm writing about my experiences with God, people around me and letting go of my past....\\n\\nI'm not using your name right now, but I'm letting you know that I'm protected and I have a large spiritual family watching over me. To everyone back in my Home State; I walked away, so I can grow into the person I am today. I learned more about life because I lived through the PAIN! \\n\\nI can't change what I may have done wrong in the past, but I'm working on myself and choosing a better path than the one I was walking. God has that gift to forgive and allow us as many chances as we need with each day we are blessed enough to wake up too. \\n\\nI can help others overcome their pain through my story. I'm not afraid to speak my truth!\\n\\n I'm not afraid to never know your truth.... I'm sure that I already do, and I am letting you go from my life now. I spiritually cut all ties to your soul (E). I may love you from afar, but I love myself more to walk away never hearing another word from you again....\\n\\nBTW, Stop stalking me on YOUTUBE! STOP CALLING ME WITH PRIVATE NUMBERS! \\n\\nTina, \\n\\nNow, I'm off to practice a song I played in Pep Band 2013...... \\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1jWTNXwJP8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1jWTNXwJP8)\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-02-11T20:33:20.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went square dancing at a church and then bowling with coworkers last night. I received a book called &amp;quot;God Winks on Love&amp;quot; Let the Power of Coincidence Lead You To Love, by; Squire Rushnell... My coworker is very touched by my encounter with her in life. We met at work of all places and she has helped me in many ways because of our conversations about life, death and God. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another coworker tells me about the chapters she reads in the Bible every morning, i make sure to ask her every day we prep together in the kitchen. I love her wisdom and the stories she tells with her sassy attitude make it even more entertaining. It brings the Bible ALIVE to me. I love working with my family. I found a place I belong, everyone really does care about working together and helping each other. We check on each other outside of work. I&amp;#39;ve never had that before, not even when I was a teacher.... People are very secluded at work. Then my retail job, I feel like I live there! Everyone I worked with for 6 years now. We are family too! I&amp;#39;ve had many conversations about God with many teenagers that take a seasonal job with us and then leave for college. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;6 Years now....

As we stay living, we remember the embrace of our first kiss, the mortal emotional suffering. What will our friends say of it? What contributions did we make?

You're married, and I won't cross that line. I live in these fantasies, because they keep me sane, oddly enough. That's the writer part of me again. I've been keeping fantasy and reality separate for forty-three years, and I'm very good at it. Still, I have this idiotic idea that someone will read one of these things, recognize you, and tell you. I know it's impossible, but it tricks my subconscious into thinking I contacted you. Better that than really contacting you.\\n\\nI can guess how you would react. You would think I was a stalker. I'm not. I've been thirty miles away from you for ten years, and I haven't gone near you. Stalkers don't respect distance or marriage vows. Even after I realized I was in love with you, I didn't go near you. It got bad a few times, at the lowest point of the depression, but I stopped myself. Mostly. I sent you that LinkedIn request, but you ignored it. That's probably for the best.\\n\\nI've said this in previous posts, but I want to say it again; I did this to myself. You don't feel the same way. I know that. What happened was internal and mostly about Asperger's Syndrome. Your contribution ended forty years ago. You owe me nothing. Yes, I love you. Yes, I want to be with you, but I can't. I understand that. That's why I'm in therapy, why I want to start antidepressants. It is my problem, and I must deal with it.\\n\\nI'm sure all of this is confusing. How could a memory do this to me? I know, from personal experience, if I can get oxytocin into my system, it will function normally. I know that from pets. Tactile interaction will release oxytocin. Hugging pets, holding them, wrestling with them, have all resulted in the formation of bonds. I have felt more grief over the death of a pet than the death of a family member. The Asperger's Syndrome prevents the release of oxytocin through non-verbal communication, but it does not stop the functioning of it if it is released. That's what that memory did, the \\\"self-soothing\\\" part of a self-soothing autobiographical memory. I released oxytocin and dopamine into my system every time I used that memory, hundreds of times over those forty years. They reinforced that memory and every other memory I have of you. They linked those memories to a positive sensation and created a sense of connection to you. The mechanism of oxytocin release was atypical; the process of falling in love was not.\\n\\nI know how crazy that sounds. Believe me. I had to justify it to myself. That's life with Asperger's. I had to find the mechanism before I would accept my own emotions. I searched for references to this, but I couldn't find any. I asked for feedback on the theory, but no one responded. I found direct reference to the release of oxytocin and dopamine in response to a positive memory, but I couldn't find anything about this specific situation. Either I'm wrong about the theory, or I'm the first person to ever do this. You'd think the Asperger community would take notice. Most of us want this kind of connection, but no one else seems to care, not in the community or outside of it. I'm still not sure if the theory is right. I only have the emotion itself to go on. It is like nothing else I've ever felt and exactly what I think it should be.\\n\\nI'm in love with you.\\n\\nI say that a lot in these posts. I can't tell you directly, so I must say it here. You probably think it's just a crush. It's not. A crush (or limerence, if you're pretentious) is very immediate and very surface. It is quick to appear and quick to disappear, and it affects a different part of the brain. I've had crushes before. I did go to high school. None of them ever caused crippling depression. I have lost entire days to you.\\n\\nIt's not even the emotion, by the way. I don't have a support structure in place. I never felt love before. I don't know how to process it. The emotion itself, on a scale of one to ten, is probably a three or four. I'm not in therapy for the emotion. I'm in therapy, because I can't be with you. I am in therapy, because I found what I wanted my entire life, I found it with the person I wanted the most, and I can't tell you.\\n\\nI hope you believe me, or at least believe the possibility. I know, if you did see this, you wouldn't respond. You have a family, and their safety must come first. If there is even a hint of doubt, you couldn't risk it, and there is a lot more than a hint in what I've said. Everything is correct, as far as I know it, but my word is obviously not enough.\\n\\nThis is why I fantasize about your divorce. I know only an idiot would divorce you, but it keeps me going on days when that's difficult. My happiness is contingent on your life being ruined. That's what I've become. I hate myself for it, but I hate the pain more. I hope, considering your background, that you'll understand that and hate me a little less.\\n\\nI would be good to you, if I could. I mean that. I've said it in other posts; the emotion is very normal. I want to date you; I want to marry you; I want to be with you. I want a normal, healthy relationship. I don't fantasize about perfection and endless happiness. I fantasize about caring and contentment. And I fantasize about telling you.\\n\\nI am in love with you.\\n\\nYou are the only love I have ever felt, and I will suffer agony to keep you. Forever and ever, if I must.\\n\\nI will always be in love with you.\\n\\nPlease believe that. As hard as that is to do. Please. Believe me.\\n\\nI am in love with you. Always.\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-02-05T23:07:58.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I write these letters to stop myself from contacting you.

That&amp;#39;s probably for the best.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve said this in previous posts, but I want to say it again; I did this to myself. You don&amp;#39;t feel the same way. I know that. What happened was internal and mostly about Asperger&amp;#39;s Syndrome. Your contribution ended forty years ago. You owe me nothing. Yes, I love you. Yes, I want to be with you, but I can&amp;#39;t. I understand that. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m in therapy, why I want to start antidepressants. It is my problem, and I must deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure all of this is confusing. How could a memory do this to me? I know, from personal experience, if I can get oxytocin into my system, it will function normally. I know that from pets. Tactile interaction will release oxytocin. Hugging pets, holding them, wrestling with them, have all resulted in the formation of bonds. I have felt more grief over the death of a pet than the death of a family member. The Asperger&amp;#39;s Syndrome prevents the release of oxytocin through non-verbal communication, but it does not stop the functioning of it if it is released. That&amp;#39;s what that memory did, the &amp;quot;self-soothing&amp;quot; part of a self-soothing autobiographical memory. I released oxytocin and dopamine into my system every time I used that memory, hundreds of times over those forty years. They reinforced that memory and every other memory I have of you. They linked those memories to a positive sensation and created a sense of connection to you. The mechanism of oxytocin release was atypical; the process of falling in love was not.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know how crazy that sounds. Believe me. I had to justify it to myself. That&amp;#39;s life with Asperger&amp;#39;s. I had to find the mechanism before I would accept my own emotions. I searched for references to this, but I couldn&amp;#39;t find any. I asked for feedback on the theory, but no one responded. I found direct reference to the release of oxytocin and dopamine in response to a positive memory, but I couldn&amp;#39;t find anything about this specific situation. Either I&amp;#39;m wrong about the theory, or I&amp;#39;m the first person to ever do this. You&amp;#39;d think the Asperger community would take notice. Most of us want this kind of connection, but no one else seems to care, not in the community or outside of it. I&amp;#39;m still not sure if the theory is right. I only have the emotion itself to go on. It is like nothing else I&amp;#39;ve ever felt and exactly what I think it should be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I say that a lot in these posts. I can&amp;#39;t tell you directly, so I must say it here. You probably think it&amp;#39;s just a crush. It&amp;#39;s not. A crush (or limerence, if you&amp;#39;re pretentious) is very immediate and very surface. It is quick to appear and quick to disappear, and it affects a different part of the brain. I&amp;#39;ve had crushes before. I did go to high school. None of them ever caused crippling depression. I have lost entire days to you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not even the emotion, by the way. I don&amp;#39;t have a support structure in place. I never felt love before. I don&amp;#39;t know how to process it. The emotion itself, on a scale of one to ten, is probably a three or four. I&amp;#39;m not in therapy for the emotion. I&amp;#39;m in therapy, because I can&amp;#39;t be with you. I am in therapy, because I found what I wanted my entire life, I found it with the person I wanted the most, and I can&amp;#39;t tell you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hope you believe me, or at least believe the possibility. I know, if you did see this, you wouldn&amp;#39;t respond. You have a family, and their safety must come first. If there is even a hint of doubt, you couldn&amp;#39;t risk it, and there is a lot more than a hint in what I&amp;#39;ve said. Everything is correct, as far as I know it, but my word is obviously not enough.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is why I fantasize about your divorce. I know only an idiot would divorce you, but it keeps me going on days when that&amp;#39;s difficult. My happiness is contingent on your life being ruined. That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve become. I hate myself for it, but I hate the pain more. I hope, considering your background, that you&amp;#39;ll understand that and hate me a little less.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I would be good to you, if I could. I mean that. I&amp;#39;ve said it in other posts; the emotion is very normal. I want to date you; I want to marry you; I want to be with you. I want a normal, healthy relationship. I don&amp;#39;t fantasize about perfection and endless happiness. I fantasize about caring and contentment. And I fantasize about telling you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You are the only love I have ever felt, and I will suffer agony to keep you. Forever and ever, if I must.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I will always be in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please believe that. As hard as that is to do. Please. Believe me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am in love with you.

Your letters, your funny affirmations, and safety \\\"features\\\" (safety first) when we hung out. When I spent more time with you, you matched the soul attached to me.

I didn't realize the sign until the food showed up. I got that on camera, too. Yay! More proof!\\n\\nWell, anyways, it's not fun living my reality right now. God told me a man was dangerous at Gonzaga last Thursday. I was leaving work. He had a large knife, and I got my phone out and called attention to him being dangerous to students. God spoke through me, and no one else cared. I was the only one that stopped it. When I was filming, my ex called to check on me meeting up that day. It was happening during this time I was yelling at the man with the knife. The video stopped recording at 1:11... 1 min and 11 seconds! OMG! It happened again and that was my sign of confirmation! I'm so happy to be of help! Because, there have been murders in Idaho recently and I just want everyone safe. (Safety first!) So, I spoke my truth and followed God's guidance. \\n\\nThere are so many songs I run across, and all speak to me with lyrics... it's very overwhelming trying to block out all the messages and work a normal job. I need your help, I want to pray with you and hear your testimony about your path with God, and how you are approaching everyday life situations with a spiritual perspective. Can you speak and receive messages from God, too? \\n\\nI think you can help ground me and teach me. People keep bringing up the story of Ed and Lorraine Warren around me... Am I supposed to look them up and connect their story to mine? Your name is the same as his. That's why people around me bring up that couple specifically. The other thing is how they met and knowing they were supposed to be together without knowing why at first. Then they became a power couple and their spiritual gifts together were heightened. They helped many others. I don't think we are going to be ghost slayers!! lol. I see your psychology background and faith will be very helpful with my abilities to connect to the other side and decipher the right way to explain it in a book so others can learn from the lesson. You said you wanted to be a college psychology professor and I see, you haven't met your goals just yet. I don't know what kind of medium I am yet. I'm not sure if it's clairvoyant, but Lorraine's story about how she suppressed her abilities as a child is similar to mine. I met Suz and she helped me understand the Bible and coincide it with the paranormal so I didn't feel like I was going to burn in hell for practicing spirituality outside of the church's philosophical approach. \\n\\nSo, this Revelation Song, played just now after I watched a movie with Mike, it was called \\\"No Exit\\\". The All-State guy plays the character, Ed! I got my phone real quick to try and film it, but I did not want to look stupid in front of Mike. But yeah, I know you told me I'll never hear from you again. I'm expecting nothing back, but I'm really exposing myself at this point, and I don't want you to hate me for putting this out there and embarrassing you. I'm sorry. I'll delete everything when you message me, I promise. I just need to see if what I'm being told is real. They told me to post this song and speak my truth.

I met Suz and she helped me understand the Bible and coincide it with the paranormal so I didn&amp;#39;t feel like I was going to burn in hell for practicing spirituality outside of the church&amp;#39;s philosophical approach. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So, this Revelation Song, played just now after I watched a movie with Mike, it was called &amp;quot;No Exit&amp;quot;. The All-State guy plays the character, Ed! I got my phone real quick to try and film it, but I did not want to look stupid in front of Mike. But yeah, I know you told me I&amp;#39;ll never hear from you again. I&amp;#39;m expecting nothing back, but I&amp;#39;m really exposing myself at this point, and I don&amp;#39;t want you to hate me for putting this out there and embarrassing you. I&amp;#39;m sorry. I&amp;#39;ll delete everything when you message me, I promise. I just need to see if what I&amp;#39;m being told is real. They told me to post this song and speak my truth. It brings me only happy memories of singing to you about loving God. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Love you Boo,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Tina,&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 3,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/10nbasw/revelation_song/\",\n            \"username\": \"Tenati0us-T\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_10lqxut\": {\n            \"title\": \"Are You My Wonderwall?\",\n            \"body\": \"1/18/23\\n\\nHey Boo.

I like to stay distracted. I stopped fucking around thinking about you. I deleted my emails addressed to you. You know, just in-case I might accidently send it to someone. I still have drafts, but it\\u2019s not easy to just stumble on like earlier. I\\u2019m getting super paranoid for sure. I\\u2019m super anxious again. My heart is racing when a thought of you crosses my mind. Small mundane things are popping up that I have no control over and it\\u2019s you all over again\\u2026. Reminding me that you\\u2019re still around. What I mean by that is\\u2026 I am able to shut you out of my head for a few days and hide anything that reminds me of you, but in my waking life\\u2026.. You find ways to fucking show back up regardless of my efforts to ignore your ass! Don\\u2019t feel bad, I kinda picture you laughing at this part of my paragraph. Because it sounds so random and elaborate, but it\\u2019s you, being cocky and sneaky! You think I only have known you for 5 months, but over the years just talking to you in spirit, I see such a different version of you now than before. It feels more accurate oddly enough\\u2026. I don\\u2019t want to say that I\\u2019m right and seem arrogant myself, but I got to be at this point of the paragraph right?!\\n\\nI\\u2019m starting to take pictures and short videos for you, to show you later of the things to attach on here while explaining the examples. I\\u2019m not very tech savvy, but I\\u2019ll do my best. What is keeping me from sleeping tonight is what happened yesterday morning. I pull up to park my car at work and as I\\u2019m turning off my podcast that fucking song plays!\\u2026. \\u201cShut Up and Dance with Me\\u201d at 5:55 am\\u2026. I got my phone out and turned off my car so you can hear my car start up and the song show up on the radio. I\\u2019m in denial, cuz\\u2026. No, just no\\u2026. Then at 5:55am, when I was going to start walking to clock in at work\\u2026. The synchronicities and the meaning behind repeating numbers\\u2026. Every time I see a clock now, I see patterns. I get phone calls or people say dumb shit like you would and I\\u2019d check the time just to make sure\\u2026\\u2026 I\\u2019m looking for every small detail, just to prove to myself, I\\u2019m not making this shit up.

Then I\\u2019d be driving, and I have a song playing that says a certain lyric about love and it stands out strongly yelling it\\u2019s words at me!  One day, I was driving with my coworker Chase, that whole day reminded me of you. I stopped my car and turned around to take a picture of a sign that had your name on it.

I\\u2019m acting different than I usually am around him. I realized what I\\u2019ve been doing this whole time now and I see it. I woke up. I put a stop to it, and I told him everything.

It wasn\\u2019t healthy by any means, but it makes sense even with all the negativity we went through. I denied what I was doing and staying, thinking he can be something he\\u2019s not\\u2026.. I see what I\\u2019m doing and instead of being afraid of facing my truth, I\\u2019ve realized, I really fucking love you a lot! If I am still thinking of you for this long and I dated a man that was basically \\u201cyou\\u201d in the best version of you I could think of creating\\u2026.

Both of you are very real and meant to be there to show me this. I hope this doesn\\u2019t turn you off to me as I\\u2019m openly sharing this information. It was kinda creepy how it all turned out, but then that\\u2019s confirmation that I never let our relationship go and I really do miss you. \\n\\nI cringe every time I hear something that sounds like you or reminds me of you in any fashion.

Now I\\u2019m playing into the largest cliche of writing down my feelings, since I\\u2019m unable to channel it through anything else. I can\\u2019t keep dragging my friends into this dreadful feeling of solitude and despair and pain. To start, I just miss you, not in the boring English way of missing someone, like a friend you haven\\u2019t spoken To in awhile or a family member you can never get around to calling\\u2026 but in the \\u201ctu me manques\\u201d / \\u201cyou are missing from me\\u201d way. I feel robbed and what\\u2019s funniest of all the person I feel robbed from did the thieving. It\\u2019s disgusting the absolute soul crushing mind-numbing severed connection I feel removed from everyday. No one will get to see this which is the most laughable, not even you. I had to type this I guess to refrain from calling, because how embarrassing and ego-bruising to allow the person who is missing out to sit above me. What\\u2019s worst of all is I would bear it, I would bear the lack of security everyday for more time, more laughter together at 4 am in my bedroom with only the light of the oil diffuser to keep us company, because honest to god it felt like we were tethered which is a bit cringey to write but it\\u2019s true. I hate that I forgive you. I hate what that makes of me, a bearer of undeserved pain. So undeserved because I couldn\\u2019t have provided any less than unconditional to the person who least deserved it. Because you left, you sat out, you ran away. But I literally couldn\\u2019t fucking care, because I have to sit here on this couch, alone. Day after day I\\u2019d rather be sitting on your bed surrounded by chaos that my god I hated but didn\\u2019t care because it made you, you. You and a reflection of the mess that was you. The you that I love. Notice the lack of past tense. I still love you. What I\\u2019d do to sit and listen to endless hours of you raging at the screen that always seemed to take priority. Just to save myself from this feeling. Like the one person who understood me couldn\\u2019t care enough. And how dare I? Bare my soul to someone who didn\\u2019t care enough. I feel so stupid, everyday, I have to face a reflection of my own stupidity. And I sit here wishing I could send this to you, because given you cared, you would be the only person I know who\\u2019d appreciate it the most. You and your stupid words of affirmation. And I know I deserve better than moments of objectification, lack of respect, and wastes of time. But I don\\u2019t care\\u2026. I care enough to not send this or call you but for some reason it gets harder. I live contradicting myself, jumping through hoops to justify contact, I\\u2019m grateful I guess because it makes what we had very real to me, which is often something I questioned. But I guess I learned too late, how funny is that. How fun would it be to send this\\u2026 funnier that you probably wouldn\\u2019t care. But it\\u2019s okay I missed you today, we\\u2019ll see if I miss you tomorrow.

I feel robbed and what\\u2019s funniest of all the person I feel robbed from did the thieving. It\\u2019s disgusting the absolute soul crushing mind-numbing severed connection I feel removed from everyday. No one will get to see this which is the most laughable, not even you. I had to type this I guess to refrain from calling, because how embarrassing and ego-bruising to allow the person who is missing out to sit above me. What\\u2019s worst of all is I would bear it, I would bear the lack of security everyday for more time, more laughter together at 4 am in my bedroom with only the light of the oil diffuser to keep us company, because honest to god it felt like we were tethered which is a bit cringey to write but it\\u2019s true. I hate that I forgive you. I hate what that makes of me, a bearer of undeserved pain. So undeserved because I couldn\\u2019t have provided any less than unconditional to the person who least deserved it. Because you left, you sat out, you ran away. But I literally couldn\\u2019t fucking care, because I have to sit here on this couch, alone. Day after day I\\u2019d rather be sitting on your bed surrounded by chaos that my god I hated but didn\\u2019t care because it made you, you. You and a reflection of the mess that was you. The you that I love. Notice the lack of past tense. I still love you. What I\\u2019d do to sit and listen to endless hours of you raging at the screen that always seemed to take priority. Just to save myself from this feeling. Like the one person who understood me couldn\\u2019t care enough. And how dare I? Bare my soul to someone who didn\\u2019t care enough. I feel so stupid, everyday, I have to face a reflection of my own stupidity. And I sit here wishing I could send this to you, because given you cared, you would be the only person I know who\\u2019d appreciate it the most. You and your stupid words of affirmation. And I know I deserve better than moments of objectification, lack of respect, and wastes of time. But I don\\u2019t care\\u2026. I care enough to not send this or call you but for some reason it gets harder. I live contradicting myself, jumping through hoops to justify contact, I\\u2019m grateful I guess because it makes what we had very real to me, which is often something I questioned. But I guess I learned too late, how funny is that. How fun would it be to send this\\u2026 funnier that you probably wouldn\\u2019t care. But it\\u2019s okay I missed you today, we\\u2019ll see if I miss you tomorrow. (Bask in my literary devices please and thank you &amp;lt;- something I think you\\u2019d find funny)&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 4,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 18,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/10ftfjx/i_miss_you_today/\",\n            \"username\": \"Educational_Neat9954\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_108et7b\": {\n            \"title\": \"dear k\",\n            \"body\": \"dear k. i love you with all my heart, entirely, i don\\u2019t think i\\u2019ve ever loved someone this much in my life. i\\u2019ve had my fair share of heart breaks but after you it seems like all that hurt has just vanished, into the oblivion never to be seen again. you\\u2019ve mended a heart you didn\\u2019t break without realising and for that i have to thank you. this letter seems like i\\u2019m picking at your flaws, that\\u2019s not my intention \\nas i\\u2019ve said i love you so much, more than i can even begin to describe but you love me, you love me more than anyone could fathom. the love you have for me is consuming, it must be exhausting. no matter what i\\u2019ve done in the past to all the other boys you don\\u2019t care. but i worry you should. you\\u2019re always the one saying not to have high expectations or saying you\\u2019re scared to mess it up, ironic isn\\u2019t it?

I find this a very good decision as it\\u2019s also one of the reasons why you came to Switzerland. But it hurts knowing you talk to other guys, go clubbing and moved on so quickly. Maybe there is someone else already in line who gives you butterflies, but what does it equate. He may make you feel beautiful but will he stay on your side when things get tough or will he just vanish. I want to stay on your side for as long as our lives last. I want to give you butterflies again every day. I know it because we have been through hard times but always made it out stronger. I want to cherish you every day and it was difficult these moments wanting to see each other but we couldn\\u2019t. I want to devote my free time I have into you as I can spend the time I need for myself while waiting for you.\\n\\nYour growing process is of course important but why can\\u2019t it happen while being on your side? Maybe things will be different than but every decision shapes you into another person. I want to have your back make you feel safe and most importantly be there in the good times and in the worst times. I know you have been through shit and I want to be the person who you can trust and look forward to at all times. You said you don\\u2019t have feelings for me anymore, however I know they are still there as it just doesn\\u2019t disappear. Love doesn\\u2019t rust even if you say so, love doesn\\u2019t rust away.\\nYou are already independent and can achieve much by yourself, yes sometimes you need my help or I help you but I don\\u2019t do it because I think you can\\u2019t but I do these things out of love. Real love. As a person grows older we become more independent, it will come naturally and I can give you more responsibility to become more independent. You can even while being on internship hang out with people, make new friends as you are a social person. You shouldn\\u2019t be sitting inside your room the whole day waiting for my texts like a bird in a cage. I encourage you to jump in the deep and gain experience or make new friends. I did the same while being with you and wanting to see you every day.\\nI remember the time I was laying with my head on you and you kissed me on my head and said \\u2018\\u2019you don\\u2019t know how much I love you\\u2019\\u2019. Thinking back this makes my heart melt and give me butterflies all the time.\\nThe world is yours and I want to conquer the world together with you.\\n\\nDo you really want to reconnect in one year or three years? Let your view get shaped by others who might mistreat you or hurt you. I fear and I am certain that it will only be harder to feel closer to each other.\\n\\nMaybe the reason what also lead to our break up was because your surrounding people were all single, but at the end of the day they all look for someone to not be alone, even if it\\u2019s just a simple hook up. You deserve better than to be treated than just a hook up and I know I have treated you cold but I know better now and I will not let you feel cold again by me. I care about you and I did make mistakes I admit. \\n\\nWe are both unique persons where we will not be a second version of and we have our own difficulties, problems, insecurities but we were there for each other. You made me quit my addiction which I am thankful for as it opened my eyes to what really matters in life and that is the present. I want to be alive in the present and being in the present with you is the greatest gift life has ever given me\\n\\nI want to go to the next stage together. Improving myself while being together. I want to be in good physique and you\\u2019re a huge motivation for me to improve myself \\n\\nYou are precious to me and I have always visualized the long term with you. We can find a solution as I am willing to fight for you, for our relationship. You said you lost your feelings for me but it\\u2019s still there on the inside. \\n\\nLet\\u2019s comeback to each other and I promise you to succeed in the next stage of our growing process\\n\\u00a0\\n\\nI let these words come from my soul and hope it touches yours. Just like the way my soul touches yours when I sleep on your chest. I was fine sleeping in a one person bed as long as you were there with me. You are the greatest gift given to me and I don\\u2019t want our love to be over, I want you back more than anything in this world\\n\\nWhen we are together the sun shines brighter, the food tastes better, the world becomes prettier and life feels better. \\n\\nPlease read this letter carefully and let your decision be decided and not the decision of others.

It all went fast and I do not regret any of it for a single second.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;you said a couple times it is not my business anymore but it still is to me since I still have feelings for you. These feelings for you will not disappear as my heart belongs to you. I feel at home wherever I am with you.

That it was okay to argue and yell at each other. Then I learned about love through romance comedy\\u2019s like \\u201827 Dresses\\u2019. I was hooked on that kind of love. I was a \\u201clove of first sight\\u201d kind of girl.\\n\\nAt a young age I met a guy who was older than me. I thought I was in love. I made the first mistake by falling in love. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted.\\n\\nI dated a stranger online. He ghosted me several weeks later. I still remember the last video he sent me on my shitty phone of him skateboarding to his class. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted.\\n\\nAs I got older I dated a few people. One guy in middle school. It only lasted a couple days because I wasn\\u2019t as popular as him. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted.\\n\\nIn high school I dated someone and I wasn\\u2019t the nicest person to him. I wasn\\u2019t even sure if I was in love. I just convinced myself I was. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted.\\n\\nI met a guy online. He was the sweetest man anyone could ask for. He was handsome and he supported me. I wasn\\u2019t even close to being as attractive as him. I remember his group chat shared a pic of me and the friends said \\u201cOh.\\u201d I felt so embarrassed. The last night we talked, we promised to watch a movie together. I didn\\u2019t show up. I deleted everything. I was so scared. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted.\\n\\nI tried dating apps. However, the people I met either lived with their ex or had me pay for the whole date.

Bumping into someone and seeing stars all around you. Suddenly, the world is vibrant, you take good care of your body and feel great. The people around you can see how happy you are. For the longest time, I never experienced that kind of love. Well. I did. Just in short bursts. From an early age, love was taught to me by my parents. That it was okay to argue and yell at each other. Then I learned about love through romance comedy\\u2019s like \\u201827 Dresses\\u2019. I was hooked on that kind of love. I was a \\u201clove of first sight\\u201d kind of girl.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At a young age I met a guy who was older than me. I thought I was in love. I made the first mistake by falling in love. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I dated a stranger online. He ghosted me several weeks later. I still remember the last video he sent me on my shitty phone of him skateboarding to his class. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I got older I dated a few people. One guy in middle school. It only lasted a couple days because I wasn\\u2019t as popular as him. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In high school I dated someone and I wasn\\u2019t the nicest person to him. I wasn\\u2019t even sure if I was in love. I just convinced myself I was. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I met a guy online. He was the sweetest man anyone could ask for. He was handsome and he supported me. I wasn\\u2019t even close to being as attractive as him. I remember his group chat shared a pic of me and the friends said \\u201cOh.\\u201d I felt so embarrassed. The last night we talked, we promised to watch a movie together. I didn\\u2019t show up. I deleted everything. I was so scared. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I tried dating apps. However, the people I met either lived with their ex or had me pay for the whole date. It wasn\\u2019t the love I wanted&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My brother married within a 2 year relationship. My sister found her high school sweetheart again and has been with him since.

A straight up habit.  I loved the rush and the fleeting moment.  In hindsight, it's a completely unique kind of romance. One which you can fully enjoy and remember as perfect without the danger of reality tarnishing that memory.  Although short-lived, it's no less intense or significant than meeting the partner you're going to spend the rest of your life with.

You wore braces and I was very careful.  After kissing for a solid 10 minutes, we shared names and you shook my hand with the cutest laugh - I loved that.  I love remembering your sense of humour.  The levity of your personality.  To this day, I still listen to these two songs in a row to relive that moment we had.  I am sorry I never asked for your number that night because I should have.  I didn't to not ruin the moment and taint it with the eventual disappointment had we carried on talking.  I hope you can forgive me and you are happy somewhere with somebody you deserve, all the while hoping you relive this memory with mutual fondness.\\n\\nElena.  I remember flirting with you as you were trying to find the queue for the cloakroom and we talked whilst collecting our coats.  It was near Christmas time and I remember using that as an excuse to steal a kiss.  You requested I add you on Facebook and, if I was being honest, I was far too old for you and always will be.  I hope you are doing amazing.\\n\\nGirl wearing a white kind of dress.  Now, this was particularly cheeky from you.  You just came out of nowhere and started kissing my face and then just randomly disappeared only to find me again at the end of the night, I pointed at you, and you just kissed me again.  You kissed me like we had been together for ten years and we had fallen in love all over again.  Then that black guy who kept following you was a bit weird.  I hope you're doing well too.\\n\\nHelen.  My beautiful barmaid.  The angel of the cloakroom.  I still think of the day you came to where I worked and I didn't realise it was you until it was too late.  You looked great, by the way.  Business dress suits you just as much as jean shorts and leggings.  I came out to look for you, y'know.  I ran out into the train station the second I could because I wanted us to have our chance, alas, it was far too late.  In all fairness, it had been many months since I gave you my number and you never called.    Whilst I'll always wonder what it'd have been like if we went on our date (I'll never forget you saying, \\\"I'd be happy with a Chinese buffet\\\" as a line), I hope you're with somebody half as great as you are and if we ever bump into each other again and the situation's right, I'd love to know how you're doing.\\n\\nThe girl in the sombrero.  Thank you.  Because without you, there'd be nobody else.\\n\\nThe place where it all happened.  When they announced you were closing, it was like a relative passing away.  It felt painful, but ultimately the right decision.  I have loved you from the start and I always will.\\n\\nLastly, to Eddy.  The best man I'll never have.  One of the only people who ever really treated me like a friend and actually cared about me.  I know you were going through a lot of bad shit just before you took your own life.  I should have been here in England with you.  Supporting you.  Actually being a friend instead of judging you and measuring myself against you.  I was too busy being selfish and blind to see that you were crying out for help.  I still see you in my dreams and those are the best dreams.  I miss you, man.  I miss you more than you'll ever know.  It is far too late for me to apologise now, but I am truly sorry.  I wish I could have been a better friend and stop this whole mess from happening.\\n\\nThank you for reading.\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2023-01-06T22:49:12.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am definitely a &amp;quot;late bloomer&amp;quot; in life.

To this day, I still listen to these two songs in a row to relive that moment we had.  I am sorry I never asked for your number that night because I should have.  I didn&amp;#39;t to not ruin the moment and taint it with the eventual disappointment had we carried on talking.  I hope you can forgive me and you are happy somewhere with somebody you deserve, all the while hoping you relive this memory with mutual fondness.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Elena.  I remember flirting with you as you were trying to find the queue for the cloakroom and we talked whilst collecting our coats.  It was near Christmas time and I remember using that as an excuse to steal a kiss.  You requested I add you on Facebook and, if I was being honest, I was far too old for you and always will be.  I hope you are doing amazing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Girl wearing a white kind of dress.  Now, this was particularly cheeky from you.  You just came out of nowhere and started kissing my face and then just randomly disappeared only to find me again at the end of the night, I pointed at you, and you just kissed me again.  You kissed me like we had been together for ten years and we had fallen in love all over again.  Then that black guy who kept following you was a bit weird.  I hope you&amp;#39;re doing well too.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Helen.  My beautiful barmaid.  The angel of the cloakroom.  I still think of the day you came to where I worked and I didn&amp;#39;t realise it was you until it was too late.  You looked great, by the way.  Business dress suits you just as much as jean shorts and leggings.  I came out to look for you, y&amp;#39;know.  I ran out into the train station the second I could because I wanted us to have our chance, alas, it was far too late.  In all fairness, it had been many months since I gave you my number and you never called.    Whilst I&amp;#39;ll always wonder what it&amp;#39;d have been like if we went on our date (I&amp;#39;ll never forget you saying, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d be happy with a Chinese buffet&amp;quot; as a line), I hope you&amp;#39;re with somebody half as great as you are and if we ever bump into each other again and the situation&amp;#39;s right, I&amp;#39;d love to know how you&amp;#39;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The girl in the sombrero.  Thank you.  Because without you, there&amp;#39;d be nobody else.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The place where it all happened.  When they announced you were closing, it was like a relative passing away.  It felt painful, but ultimately the right decision.  I have loved you from the start and I always will.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Lastly, to Eddy.  The best man I&amp;#39;ll never have.  One of the only people who ever really treated me like a friend and actually cared about me.  I know you were going through a lot of bad shit just before you took your own life.  I should have been here in England with you.  Supporting you.  Actually being a friend instead of judging you and measuring myself against you.  I was too busy being selfish and blind to see that you were crying out for help.  I still see you in my dreams and those are the best dreams.  I miss you, man.  I miss you more than you&amp;#39;ll ever know.  It is far too late for me to apologise now, but I am truly sorry.  I wish I could have been a better friend and stop this whole mess from happening.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 8,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1058567/to_all_the_strangers_i_have_met_and_loved_in_the/\",\n            \"username\": \"average_ukpf_user\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_1070vmw\": {\n            \"title\": \"Here it is.\",\n            \"body\": \"You don\\u2019t love me anymore.

i wish you didn't always tell me what a good man i am (was) and how \\\"any girl would be lucky to be with you\\\". because i made puzzle pieces out of all those things you said and they always constructed a beautiful future of me and you and now I don't know that that's the truth. \\n\\ni wanted to tell you everything before i finally did but you were so cracked and vulnerable and your dad had just been diagnosed with cancer and your lover was on his bullshit again and you seemed to need me in a way that i couldn't bring myself to deny from you because i felt you cracking and needing comfort and glue and i thought i could hold you together even though i was breaking me in two and when i finally sent you that letter I think I waited weeks maybe months for your response and i pretended like i didn't think that you must had received it and I think I asked but you ducked and dodged and maybe even lied. what letter? never mind. \\n\\nbut in december of 2020 the pressure and pain finally did me in and i broke like a fractured dam compulsively flooding all my wildest emotions and delusions and dreams and all my darkest secrets and scars and shames straight to Facebook. it wasn't all about you but a lot of it was and i didn't say your name but i don't think i really needed to. we were so close that i think all our friends already knew how i felt about you so i sent you those texts telling you i was done with the games and knew you were ashamed to give up on 8 years even if it was filled with hurt because you could see beneath the pain and red flags and you were determined to fix him and i told you i loved you for that and there would be a good man waiting for you if you ever wanted a give a shot at something different. but for my sake i had to insist that we not talk again until you finally confronted this. i think i'll probably have to wait forever or until my brain snaps in two (again) leaving me unglued (again) \\n\\ni was high for months after that night and thought i was gifted premonisions through which i could manipulate your eventual decisions. i was unhinged and i was wrong but i kept sharing song after song straight to my story choosing 15 seconds of lyrics that i thought were written about me and should be sung for you. you watched every story like a stalker in my dark and i felt pretty clever and gifted but after those months gravity began to pull me back down and i realized i was the one who had become completely unglued because you were still warm in the arms of your abuser and i was (still am) out in the cold feeling used but also suffering the gut wrenching withdrawals of just another habitual addict. shit, even my drug addiction was easier to kick than this. \\n\\ni can kind of still remember some of the good times like when we first became friends and we would hangout at the bar all night at all those shows as our friends band played up there on the stage and we'd laugh and smoke cigarettes and relate about different things and occasionally we'd do a little cocaine and that would be our little secret and it would help us spill more of our little secrets which drew us closer together until maybe it seemed a little weird to our friends because your boyfriend was on the stage plugged into an amp and playing on his guitar but i didn't have no scummy intentions even though i could feel the infatuation invading into my brain because the signs of abuse hadn't shown and i couldn't bring myself to push me away because you were at every show and so was i. \\n\\nour mutual friends forced us together like some force of gravity or fate and eventually we became so close that you'd call me on the phone at like 9pm and we would laugh over silly stories and secrets until it was like midnight or 1am and a couple days later we'd get together in some parking lot to smoke a cigarette and a couple bowls or a few hits from the pen and few days later we would meet at the bar at another show and do it all over again \\n\\ni moved across state lines to allow us room to grow \\n\\nit didn't really work because those late night calls continued for years until i finally broke and i still miss you like every day no matter the medications i take or any of the mantras i say\\n\\ni'm sorry, my love \\n\\nbut i still need this distance\\n\\ni'm sorry\\n\\nbest of luck\",\n            \"createdAt\":

&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;i barely remember what we would laugh about but I think I&amp;#39;ll always remember when you called me from his friends wedding crying about how he caused a big scene where he threatened your relationship and then gaslit you all in front of his friends and then left you on your own. or how he drove out to the backwoods and fucked that gross fifty something year old who I helped you track down because you were suspicious after he brought you lunch and flowers at work out of the blue and we found out that that was right before he drove off and cheated on you. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;i wish I could but I can&amp;#39;t forget all those times you found him on grimy dating sites or discovered his dms to his female coworkers. my brain won&amp;#39;t erase you telling me he said he didn&amp;#39;t love you anymore or about those times that he packed his shit up and left you with the bill because he said you wouldn&amp;#39;t let him breath or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;i still remember his cyclical tendencies. how you would call me afterwards so happy that he had come back and was being so romantic and full of all the apologies and sweet words and pretty promises and how you thought that things were finally going to change this time but I always knew they wouldn&amp;#39;t and you always called when they didn&amp;#39;t. saying &amp;quot;I should have listened to you&amp;quot;.

I&amp;#39;m just picky. Yeah I&amp;#39;m doing great. I&amp;#39;ve just been busy&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;i wish you never flattered me with compliments on my looks or my personality. i wish you never told me that the night you and him crashed at my place you left the guest-room door cracked open while you were having sex because you were hoping i would join for the night.

Kicking off with a littke bit of context, I (19M) have a newly (for me) discovered kind of crush for Mr. Decent (just created this account and thought about the sweet irony of it), who is a classmate of mine at uni (he's 20M). He's also straight. Nonetheless, before going on the 'oh, I fell for a straight guy' thingy, I'll tell you that throughout my teenages and their hormonal changes I had several 'crushes' (and let's draw some lines here, Crush != True Crush and Crush != Personal Crush and Personal Crush != True Crush, got it? I'll explain along the way) who were nothing more than guys who had sex appeal or actors, dot. \\n\\nFor guys who I met irl and qualified for it, it was quite stingy to have my attention driven away and my hormones going crazy for them, but as long as the dopamine hit ended, I was fine. It was like that for most of my teenages until I fell in love for a long-distance person, but I actually didn't. My first love was someone who I idealized and became emotionally dependent on. 3 years (with interruptions) of that babe; it made me go through a lot, and I knew what emotions were. Nowadays I've went throught a lot of emotional healing and that person and I solved things, I don't hate him (let's call him L for reference purposes) anymore.\\n\\nA True Crush is someone I really feel bad for not being with, normally associated with having developed something with that person, Remember L? You go with that. A person can be Crush, True Crush, and Personal Crush at the same time, btw.\\n\\nNow... A Personal Crush. *Sigh*\\n\\n\\nMr. Decent and I met in person 7 months ago. Before that, I had seen his photos on social media and was, not gonna lie, immediateky attracted just because he's got the sex appeal that's 90% my type. He became a Crush and time went by. I was able to completely forget about him for a long time because a) I didn't know we were classmates on some courses, b) It was back on quarantine that I saw the photo, c) It was only a photo, nothing special about a dopamine hit. Now, when lockdows ended and we started going to on-site classes at uni, we met. I was shocked, to say the least, that we were gonna spend like 7 to 10 hours weekly together (we take the same commute route, he actually lives 10 min on foot from my house), but at the end of the day I didn't mind it much as I had already processed the dopamine hit beforehand.\\n\\nHe turned out to have much more to him than just sex appeal. His IQ is beautiful, he's got moral values, he's assertive, thoughtful, masculine, methodic, and... I could go on. We've been developing a friendship, and I really do feel some just-friendly vibes to him... But he's so much more special. Special enough to shine my day with just a smile, or to make me undoubtely sensitive when he's around. What I feel for him is, on one side, very much personal.\\n\\nOn the other side, I am, and have been devoid of physical, caring touch for all my life (I do have a loving family, but one of my biggest dreams is just to lie in bed with a soul that resonates with mine next to me, in utter peace), and he's become the trigger for that longing.\\n\\nDisclaimers ahead. \\n\\nI do have tested what I feel, what I think I feel, and what I think about him. I am not blind of neurochemicals enough to only see his good side, but that exactly is what makes him a personal crush. I think I've fallen down to mother earth for him.\\n\\nSecond disclaimer is that I know and accept that he's straight, and I know and accept that one can't change other people's sexual orientation, nor approaching him sexually would be less than utterly disrespecful for both him and (more importantly) me, because I don't deserve to be put my heart on my sleeve for everyone to see that I've got a non-corresponded love.\\n\\nI am here, voicing that I feel all of this in an act of love towards us both.\\n\\nNow, how did he become 'Mr. Decent'?\\n\\nLong story short, when I was telling one of my best friends about him, I described him in my head, and syntesized everything I think of him as being a 'Decent' person among everyone, as being more decent than most of the people I have met (I'm saying they're not decent, human people, but surely among the first persons that pop up in my head when I think about it is him, right next to my beloved lady mother). Now, under that definition I'm also Mr. Decent (as I consider myself a decent person as well)...\\n\\nI'm making this post because I accept what's happening, but my heart tenders when I write about him.\\n\\nThis post is for Mr. Decent, the one who has a part of my heart.\\n\\nThis post also is for Mr. Decent, the one that is writing these lines.\\n\\nFor any homosexual guys or girls that fall for straight people: Acknowledge what is outside your sphere of control, feel what you need to feel, accept your emotions and let yourselves be free, not neglecting, not denying, not suffering, just being.\\n\\n\\nPD: In my hands is the literal decision to stop seeing Mr. Decent for 8 hours a week next year. I dunno what to do.\\n\\nPD2: As per the rules, I did not create this account JUST for this post, but I did create it recently. I'll probably be wandering around here for a while.

But i don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;ll help, because then I&amp;#39;ll just dream of you, and that would break my broken heart into a thousand little pieces.\\nI don&amp;#39;t know how to describe it, scared, thrilled, full, empty, happy, sad, the feeling i get when i wake up from a dream of you, of us, happy, together, in love.\\nI probably shouldn&amp;#39;t talk about love, because talking about love after 12 a.m. never ends well. But do you remember that time you wrote me a letter but you were too scared to give it to me, so you sent Dave as a messenger and he read it, and made fun of you for calling me &amp;#39;my little butterfly&amp;#39; for a whole school year? And how you never wrote anything for me again? Dave&amp;#39;s a dick, you should have definitely wrote me more.\\nIt&amp;#39;s getting late, almost 3 a.m. and i have a presentation tomorrow, so i should probably sleep, but like i said, you steal all my dreams away but a part of me doesn&amp;#39;t want to ask you to give them back, cause that&amp;#39;s the only way we get to see each other.\\nI&amp;#39;ll end here, cause i can never seem to know when to stop when it comes to you.\\nGoodnight, JJ\\nYours always,\\nRinzuali&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 3,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/y3a6cw/dear_jacob/\",\n            \"username\": \"ofstarsandlove\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_y21j8y\": {\n            \"title\": \"Alive\",\n            \"body\": \"He cannot love me.

I took you back...even though I learned.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t care...I loved you...and I knew. I knew you could leave me...I knew you could be without me. I knew you didn&amp;#39;t come back for love. I didn&amp;#39;t care.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought we would make it. After all the years together. I just thought we were past ever losing each other. I never thought anything like this would ever happen. I never thought we would be put to the test. I already know I ain&amp;#39;t the one...I know I wasn&amp;#39;t the best. I know I can&amp;#39;t keep you...there&amp;#39;s nothing I can do...once again I have lost you...I have been put to rest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I miss you so much...I don&amp;#39;t have any choice. Shelby I miss the sound of your voice. Now even when you talk to me you are just so mad...I can&amp;#39;t talk to you cause I am just so sad.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am still in here Shelby... the outside isn&amp;#39;t me. There&amp;#39;s nothing I can do... it just has to be. I know it&amp;#39;s not forever...but you&amp;#39;re living now. I just have to take it...tho I don&amp;#39;t know how. This is as cruel as it can be... it&amp;#39;s torturing me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thirty-eight years Shelby...I have never kissed another girl...I have never held anyone else&amp;#39;s hand. The love I have, I don&amp;#39;t understand. I thought I had it all...I have used up my whole life and I have nothing at all. There is no one around me...I am not held dear...no one has cared, and I have been gone for years.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You are the only one I have ever needed. The only one I have ever counted on. FTW...as long as I had you. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I lost my tools...hard to believe. I had notes in there from you I couldn&amp;#39;t retrieve. Seems everything is gone there is not even a trace. Everything that I was has just been erased.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I had the courage to just let you go. I really need the courage to just let myself go. I don&amp;#39;t think I can do it...I think that you can. I think it&amp;#39;s all left up to you...I am no longer a man. Put an end to it...I know that you can.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t blame you for anything. You have done the best that you could. Life has to move on... anyone would.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I am just heart broken Shelby...I am just no good. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey you...I love you babe...I miss you. I would do anything to kiss you. I can&amp;#39;t. Not even if you wanted me to. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have to stop writing... thanks for the Arby&amp;#39;s. I don&amp;#39;t know why I deserved it but thank you. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for everything Shelby. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Everyday I say good morning and goodbye. I hope you have a good day and I will see you later. I tell you I love you and I wish you didn&amp;#39;t have to go... you can&amp;#39;t hear what I say...I just thought you should know...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll see you when we get back here...bye&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 5,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/xay42t/hey_you/\",\n            \"username\": \"reversible_polymer\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_wsfdau\": {\n            \"title\": \"Would love to send this to you right now.\",\n            \"body\": \"URL: https://i.redd.it/hn94fwnwjoi91.jpg\\n\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2022-08-19T14:26:07.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"URL: https://i.redd.it/hn94fwnwjoi91.jpg\\n\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 1,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 33,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/wsfdau/would_love_to_send_this_to_you_right_now/\",\n            \"username\": \"[deleted]\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_wxvaqx\": {\n            \"title\": \"For Him.\",\n            \"body\": \"**This is kind of long, It's a letter to someone I once loved but am now trying to get over.** \\n\\n \\n\\nWhen I first met you I was a completely different person than I am today. I was relatively innocent and my mind was easily influenced. \\n\\nYou thought you were the most important person in the room and I countered that with the thought of us all being insignificant in this small room, city, town. We\\u2019d grow up and move away. Some of us would become great, other\\u2019s stuck working the classic 9-5 until they\\u2019re old and gray. Whoever you thought you were didn\\u2019t matter 10 years from now. I was too smart for that class, English 1. I knew I could do better. \\n\\nIt started when I was sitting in the very back of the classroom without my glasses. I couldn't see anything. I didn\\u2019t know you yet but you sat in the front of the other half of the room. I guess that was a sort of symbolism to show the gap between us on the scale of things at the time. I was still relatively un concerned with knowing a lot of people at school, most of the people who were aware of me were just that, aware of me. Whether it was through my more popular friends, elementary school classes, or my sudden appearance during middle school. You didn\\u2019t know me though. And I didn\\u2019t know you in the slightest. When I was moved to the front into the seat across from you I first heard your voice, it felt as if in the back I couldn\\u2019t hear a word you were saying. But here. Front and center, though I didn\\u2019t know your face I knew your voice first.\\n\\nYou were loud, funny even. I could tell what type of person you were but I didn\\u2019t immediately turn away, I was curious. And that might\\u2019ve been the start of my downfall. Curiosity. \\n\\n A week later I had new glasses, they were black and rectangular and ugly. I was still in the hopes of transferring out of that class but I\\u2019d developed a connection to our meek teacher. I\\u2019d also grown a fascination towards you, often thinking about how I\\u2019d miss your jokes if I left. So I told my counselor I was fine where I was. I\\u2019d also attached a face to a voice by now. You were dark and your confidence was alluring, for I had not so easily ever had to look someone like you in the face for so long. It was fascinating. \\n\\nWe were polar opposites, you dressed well and held yourself like you were on top of the world. I had not acquired a fashion sense yet and I shamefully walked the halls, praying nobody saw me. I was a sad person really, I had just learned simple styles to do my hair with and it didn\\u2019t help that I'd spent the entirety of summer in a house with nobody but my family. I wanted out, an escape. You felt forbidden almost, and I was being tempted.\\n\\nI pitied our teacher and made an effort to answer most of the questions as everyone else turned her out or learned in silence. I knew one other person in the class who sometimes helped her out, he was also a close friend of yours and an old classmate of mine. (let's call him Bob) Bob was chill for the most part, he was on the football team with you but acted totally different from the rest of the players. Sure he\\u2019d joke around but I\\u2019d never heard Bob being as disgusting as his mates. But I also didn\\u2019t know him, we had math together in seventh grade but that was about it, never exchanged any words really and he openly let me know that back then he was convinced I was special ed\\u2026. Bob tried in class and he had the second highest grade in her class, after me of course. \\n\\nThis was your second time in this class, our teacher made that known with the familiarity she held with you. I almost felt bad but i\\u2019d seen your type a million times before, it was nothing new. So why did I feel so bad about it? It had been only eleven day of school before I asked Bob for your number. I should\\u2019ve never done it. Never. But I did and I got your snap. We talked there for a couple hours before exchanging numbers and texting through imessage. You were bold, I do not have these messages anymore but I do remember that.\\n\\nI made it clear I wasn\\u2019t as nerdy as I seemed in our shared class but looking back on myself at that point in life it was a lie. You wanted \\u201cthings\\u201d from me and I was too far into the first stage of my fast and hard addiction towards you. I flirted back, entertained the idea swearing up and down it'll never happen. I was sure of it. Positive even. The texts between messages and snap went on for awhile, I started helping you out in class, obsessing over my hair and lack of good clothing. I told my friends about you to a certain extent leaving out that fact that I had you as a saved contact. When I asked you about yourself I didn\\u2019t like the response. I found it boring and it matched the way to present yourself exactly. What kept me hooked was the way you countered yourself constantly, sure the obscene gestures you\\u2019d present in class were nothing but immature and vile but I thought it was funny me being the same way secretly. \\n\\nI remember the day our teacher trusted you with a new seat, the one directly beside me. I panicked going up to her after class. She knew I liked you. I know she did. She then asked me something I\\u2019d never given a thought to before. \\u201cAre you sure you can handle sitting by him?\\u201d she said she\\u2019d sat you beside me because she knew I could deal with your personality, with fear of her moving you without missing a beat I said yes. I wanted you there. \\n\\nThe next bit of this is gross. I can\\u2019t ever think about this day without almost bringing myself to tears, it was the day I changed a lot as a person. September 10th. You kept hinting at it during class, I was a little scared to shut you down, I wanted you to continue acknowledging me. Looking back I should've asked to changed seats immediately. There was no advice in the world that would\\u2019ve gotten me to do it though.\\n\\n I said yes and as soon as the bell rang you got up urging me to follow you. I had little to no time to reflect and really think about what I was doing. You were walking so fast I left my friend in the other class trailing behind my speed walk to keep up to you. She asked where I was going, what the hell I was doing. I honestly didn\\u2019t know. It was a friday. I know that much, See I\\u2019m the type of person to really think about all the possible consequences to my choices before doing them. I knew who you were, I knew what you were too. A literal whore. \\n\\nWhen we got to the gym I saw my cousin and my friend staying there, I hesitated \\u201c**Are you coming**?\\u201d I continued walking. We got to the place and you stared at me, my mouth went dry and I wanted to cry and leave. \\n\\nTwo sides of myself fighting each other one telling me to leave and stop being stupid and the other dangerous side telling me that i\\u2019d gone too far to stop now that i couldn\\u2019t be a pussy, was I a pussy? I wish I was in that moment, I wish I\\u2019d listen to my mind that overthinks to the fullest extreme. \\u201c**Are you gonna do it or not?**\\u201d \\u2018*no*\\u2019 \\u201c**Fuck it**.\\u201d \\n\\nThe next few days were spent crying and beating myself up about it. Was this really me? The worst part about it is that I felt bad about my performance and me being the overachiever I am, I learned absolutely nothing good and did it again. \\n\\n More beating myself up. Now the problem was I was hooked on you. I\\u2019d never done even so much as kissed anyone and so I developed a fast attachment to you. I am always locating wherever you happen to be in the area. Not to be creepy but to keep myself from wondering. I just liked being aware. \\n\\nI continued to help you in class but you quickly made my life hell only it didn\\u2019t quite reach me. \\u201cFriday\\u201d that asshat nickname. I knew who was aware of what happened and who wasn\\u2019t. Yet I didn\\u2019t care because I only really gave a rat\\u2019s ass about what you thought. Sure I hated it and cried about it, but it didn\\u2019t really matter considering it never left the classroom. I still continued to go to your games and help you with work. \\n\\n   Jumping towards november we were working on a project together and I went on my phone. I remember hearing the back and forth but I didn\\u2019t realize who it was between at the time brushing it off as you and Bob going at it at one another. It wasn\\u2019t Bob. When you stood up, I instantly noticed the cold air that hit my shoulder. I looked up and my heart sunk. Though we talked you into sitting down the second you turned away he hit you, that was the end of that. You swung on him and beat him into the ground, he was a pretty big dude, bigger than Bob. He fell hard; my desk sliding across the room with me in it. I jumped up and eventually removed myself from the situation. This was bad. With all the fights that had happened, expulsion was a likely scenario considering your cousin has jumped in to help. I knew this. \\n\\nYou weren't at school the next day but it was all anyone was talking about. I texted you in a bit of a panic checking up and all that. Our teacher expressed how she was going to try her best to save you in her statement but I knew that might not be enough, it was out of her job description. I often forget this bit but I wanted to share it anyway. I remember reading the report she wrote and cringing at the bits that could possibly be used against you. I couldn\\u2019t with good conscience turn this into your administrator and hope for the best. So I went upstairs and explained the situation to a trusted teacher who often helped me get away with things. He helped me edit and reprint her statement to make you look better. I then delivered it to your administrator, our now principal. This part is grosser than anything else I\\u2019ve said leading up to this point. I remember asking her how it was looking, she couldn\\u2019t go into details. I was not kin nore your girlfriend or whatever. I introduced myself as someone who was just concerned with no ill intent. I wasn\\u2019t happy with the answer I got but I knew that statement was enough to get you off the hook even a little bit. I could never tell you this, it seems obsessive and weird. I kind of am though if you couldn't tell from the get go.\\n\\nTo sum it up you were expelled to the other school for 45 days. That was way less than everyone else was getting so I was happy. What didn\\u2019t help was our teacher bringing it up every single day and then proceeding to drag me into the conversation. We spoke while you were out maybe once or twice. \\n\\nI attempted to unattach myself from you during this time as well. I knew your type very well. I had a few failed talking stages, most of them being ruined by your friends bringing what I did with you up to them or me subconsciously comparing them to you and completely losing attraction if I thought for a second you\\u2019d just laugh at them. I needed someone you more or less respected. \\n\\nAround this time I\\u2019d also taken a bigger liking towards drugs, often showing up to school and work high off my ass. It was nice, but I also didn\\u2019t get much school work done. It was pretty bad. I was sad, everything in the months prior distracted me from myself and being left alone with these thoughts in my addict ass subspace wasn\\u2019t a good mix. I tried to get out of it but it was just so comforting. The dropping of my grades was enough to put stress and anger into the mix. I was not making smart choices. \\n\\n   I eventually shut down and ended up in the emergency room. I spent the majority of that time crying and thinking about how weirded out you would be if you knew. I also plotted on killing myself the first three days. I could do nothing but sit there, eat, sleep, and read the same book over and over again. I did just that, mostly sleeping and sometimes being able to color. That place was really fucking weird and all I wanted to do was leave. I didn\\u2019t deserve to be there, it was literal hell. This is around the time you came back to school. I knew it was your return week and I was in the hospital for the entirety of it. When I got out I saw you in the commons at school and any attempt to forget you was tossed out the window. The second day I saw you, you happened to also see me \\u201c**I know that\\u2019s not \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_**.\\u201d I said Hey. That was a mistake as well. \\n\\nI was not the same person I was when we first met. I believed you were on top of the world. The most important person in the room. You had big things waiting for you and everyone in our school knew it. You were somebody and the world didn\\u2019t know it yet. \\n\\nWe had moved to a new area the day I was released. My dog had also given up whilst I was gone. I didn't feel much as things were moving very quickly and I didn\\u2019t have much time to process. It just so happens that you live a few minutes away from me, a minute drive at most, maybe a 10-15 minute walk if you\\u2019re a slow walker. This was bad. \\n\\n  We rode the same bus now. At the time I was so happy about it even though I never said it outloud. We had different classes but I still had to see you on the daily, it wasn\\u2019t long before you realized what a score it was for you and eventually you showed up at my house.\\n\\n   I\\u2019d told you I was a virgin before but you didn\\u2019t care enough to remember so when you asked on this day I lied. I didn\\u2019t cry, I didn\\u2019t want you to know. \\n\\n  I must've done something right because that day turned into once a week which turned into whenever you didn\\u2019t have a game or practice. It bled into the summer and you were over often. Me and my friend, the same one who all those months ago all but ran behind me to stop me from following you helped me take the car and you and him and would come over, a \\u201ctwo man\\u201d I guess or whatever. It was fun, we smoked, we drove around. We never really went anywhere but I still wasn\\u2019t too into parties or any of that shit so it didn\\u2019t really matter to me. I was addicted to every part of you and the summer was a haze. I cried and screamed. I pleaded with myself to stop. I knew nothing good would come out of it.\\n\\n  That must've been the same side of me that told me to walk away back on September 10th. I tried. Fuck. You know I tried, I told you the truth, I cried to my friends about it, I cried to my grandma about it. Yet I just didn\\u2019t know when to quit. \\n\\n Before school ended I saw you walking with her, I was in front of yall and heard the entirety of the conversation. I was pissed for the most part. But I all but prayed it didn\\u2019t go anywhere. We weren\\u2019t anywhere close to being something. I was stupid to hope because now I see you two everywhere. In the process of straightening my schedule out I ended up with the same lunch and now I sit with people I couldn\\u2019t give less of a fuck about as our friendship ran dry years prior and the punishment for doing stupid shit being to watch you talk and walk with her as I sit there in pain while I'm burdened with trying to figure the fuck out how to abort this baby before it\\u2019s too late. \\n\\n  Oh I know you remember recent events well. I told you and you looked at me stupid. Accused me of being with other people- well you were not entirely wrong but one of those \\u201cpeople\\u201d was a girl and the other I did no more than make out with. So that shit really hurt. I even in my darkest moment went as far as to attempt to talk to you and see if you had any input, ideas, support even. But no as everything goes you blamed me and made me feel like shit. I grew tired of being so nice to you. I\\u2019ve always been so fucking nice. I told you that I didn\\u2019t care if you were with \\u201cher\\u2019 because she really is a nice girl. I told you I didn\\u2019t want the kid. I told you I\\u2019d keep it since you\\u2019re providing no help with this shit. I don't want a baby. I cannot have a baby ruin both of our lives. I\\u2019m on track to graduating with an associates degree with still little regard for my mental health and you are quite literally one of the best on our football team. \\n\\nI wouldn\\u2019t want to mess you up..You told me I knew what I was doing, that it was purposeful, you yelled at me. You told me you didn\\u2019t want me when at no point did I even HINT at wanting something more. You broke me. I\\u2019m so stupid I feel numb towards everything and everyone. I haven\\u2019t told my mom I haven\\u2019t done anything yet and I\\u2019m on a timer.  \\n\\n I think I did accomplish one thing though. I don\\u2019t care about you anymore. I feel nothing towards you and don\\u2019t see how I ever found you exciting. You\\u2019re a dumbass jock. I\\u2019m not the type to hold grudges so I release everything now. I know I loved everything about you at some point and the sweet moments we had will always be a part of me. I remember laughing and the times you defended me. I remember when you first showed up to my house rapping a song I now listen to daily. I remember changing myself for you, the conversations in my room. I remember when I first saw you. I also remember wishing you truly saw me. Really saw me and all I had to give you. I won\\u2019t be bitter, I won't be cruel. I\\u2019ll get rid of it and leave you alone. When I start coming back to school I\\u2019ll stand by these rules. I won\\u2019t bend, I won't fold. I\\u2019m a completely different person than I was when you were nothing but a voice, a temptation, a fruit I all but finished before realizing how rotten it truly was. You are nobody in this world and neither am I.\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2022-08-26T01:12:23.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is kind of long, It&amp;#39;s a letter to someone I once loved but am now trying to get over.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I first met you I was a completely different person than I am today.

I found it boring and it matched the way to present yourself exactly. What kept me hooked was the way you countered yourself constantly, sure the obscene gestures you\\u2019d present in class were nothing but immature and vile but I thought it was funny me being the same way secretly. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I remember the day our teacher trusted you with a new seat, the one directly beside me. I panicked going up to her after class. She knew I liked you. I know she did. She then asked me something I\\u2019d never given a thought to before. \\u201cAre you sure you can handle sitting by him?\\u201d she said she\\u2019d sat you beside me because she knew I could deal with your personality, with fear of her moving you without missing a beat I said yes. I wanted you there. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next bit of this is gross. I can\\u2019t ever think about this day without almost bringing myself to tears, it was the day I changed a lot as a person. September 10th. You kept hinting at it during class, I was a little scared to shut you down, I wanted you to continue acknowledging me. Looking back I should&amp;#39;ve asked to changed seats immediately. There was no advice in the world that would\\u2019ve gotten me to do it though.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I said yes and as soon as the bell rang you got up urging me to follow you. I had little to no time to reflect and really think about what I was doing. You were walking so fast I left my friend in the other class trailing behind my speed walk to keep up to you. She asked where I was going, what the hell I was doing. I honestly didn\\u2019t know. It was a friday. I know that much, See I\\u2019m the type of person to really think about all the possible consequences to my choices before doing them. I knew who you were, I knew what you were too. A literal whore. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we got to the gym I saw my cousin and my friend staying there, I hesitated \\u201c&lt;strong&gt;Are you coming&lt;/strong&gt;?\\u201d I continued walking. We got to the place and you stared at me, my mouth went dry and I wanted to cry and leave. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Two sides of myself fighting each other one telling me to leave and stop being stupid and the other dangerous side telling me that i\\u2019d gone too far to stop now that i couldn\\u2019t be a pussy, was I a pussy? I wish I was in that moment, I wish I\\u2019d listen to my mind that overthinks to the fullest extreme. \\u201c&lt;strong&gt;Are you gonna do it or not?&lt;/strong&gt;\\u201d \\u2018&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;\\u2019 \\u201c&lt;strong&gt;Fuck it&lt;/strong&gt;.\\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next few days were spent crying and beating myself up about it. Was this really me? The worst part about it is that I felt bad about my performance and me being the overachiever I am, I learned absolutely nothing good and did it again. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;More beating myself up. Now the problem was I was hooked on you. I\\u2019d never done even so much as kissed anyone and so I developed a fast attachment to you. I am always locating wherever you happen to be in the area. Not to be creepy but to keep myself from wondering. I just liked being aware. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued to help you in class but you quickly made my life hell only it didn\\u2019t quite reach me. \\u201cFriday\\u201d that asshat nickname. I knew who was aware of what happened and who wasn\\u2019t. Yet I didn\\u2019t care because I only really gave a rat\\u2019s ass about what you thought. Sure I hated it and cried about it, but it didn\\u2019t really matter considering it never left the classroom. I still continued to go to your games and help you with work. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Jumping towards november we were working on a project together and I went on my phone. I remember hearing the back and forth but I didn\\u2019t realize who it was between at the time brushing it off as you and Bob going at it at one another. It wasn\\u2019t Bob. When you stood up, I instantly noticed the cold air that hit my shoulder. I looked up and my heart sunk. Though we talked you into sitting down the second you turned away he hit you, that was the end of that. You swung on him and beat him into the ground, he was a pretty big dude, bigger than Bob. He fell hard; my desk sliding across the room with me in it. I jumped up and eventually removed myself from the situation. This was bad. With all the fights that had happened, expulsion was a likely scenario considering your cousin has jumped in to help. I knew this. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You weren&amp;#39;t at school the next day but it was all anyone was talking about. I texted you in a bit of a panic checking up and all that. Our teacher expressed how she was going to try her best to save you in her statement but I knew that might not be enough, it was out of her job description. I often forget this bit but I wanted to share it anyway. I remember reading the report she wrote and cringing at the bits that could possibly be used against you. I couldn\\u2019t with good conscience turn this into your administrator and hope for the best. So I went upstairs and explained the situation to a trusted teacher who often helped me get away with things. He helped me edit and reprint her statement to make you look better. I then delivered it to your administrator, our now principal. This part is grosser than anything else I\\u2019ve said leading up to this point. I remember asking her how it was looking, she couldn\\u2019t go into details. I was not kin nore your girlfriend or whatever. I introduced myself as someone who was just concerned with no ill intent. I wasn\\u2019t happy with the answer I got but I knew that statement was enough to get you off the hook even a little bit. I could never tell you this, it seems obsessive and weird. I kind of am though if you couldn&amp;#39;t tell from the get go.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To sum it up you were expelled to the other school for 45 days. That was way less than everyone else was getting so I was happy. What didn\\u2019t help was our teacher bringing it up every single day and then proceeding to drag me into the conversation. We spoke while you were out maybe once or twice. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I attempted to unattach myself from you during this time as well. I knew your type very well. I had a few failed talking stages, most of them being ruined by your friends bringing what I did with you up to them or me subconsciously comparing them to you and completely losing attraction if I thought for a second you\\u2019d just laugh at them. I needed someone you more or less respected. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Around this time I\\u2019d also taken a bigger liking towards drugs, often showing up to school and work high off my ass. It was nice, but I also didn\\u2019t get much school work done. It was pretty bad. I was sad, everything in the months prior distracted me from myself and being left alone with these thoughts in my addict ass subspace wasn\\u2019t a good mix. I tried to get out of it but it was just so comforting. The dropping of my grades was enough to put stress and anger into the mix. I was not making smart choices. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I eventually shut down and ended up in the emergency room. I spent the majority of that time crying and thinking about how weirded out you would be if you knew. I also plotted on killing myself the first three days. I could do nothing but sit there, eat, sleep, and read the same book over and over again. I did just that, mostly sleeping and sometimes being able to color. That place was really fucking weird and all I wanted to do was leave. I didn\\u2019t deserve to be there, it was literal hell. This is around the time you came back to school. I knew it was your return week and I was in the hospital for the entirety of it. When I got out I saw you in the commons at school and any attempt to forget you was tossed out the window. The second day I saw you, you happened to also see me \\u201c&lt;strong&gt;I know that\\u2019s not _____&lt;/strong&gt;.\\u201d I said Hey. That was a mistake as well. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I was not the same person I was when we first met. I believed you were on top of the world. The most important person in the room. You had big things waiting for you and everyone in our school knew it. You were somebody and the world didn\\u2019t know it yet. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We had moved to a new area the day I was released. My dog had also given up whilst I was gone. I didn&amp;#39;t feel much as things were moving very quickly and I didn\\u2019t have much time to process. It just so happens that you live a few minutes away from me, a minute drive at most, maybe a 10-15 minute walk if you\\u2019re a slow walker. This was bad. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We rode the same bus now. At the time I was so happy about it even though I never said it outloud. We had different classes but I still had to see you on the daily, it wasn\\u2019t long before you realized what a score it was for you and eventually you showed up at my house.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I\\u2019d told you I was a virgin before but you didn\\u2019t care enough to remember so when you asked on this day I lied. I didn\\u2019t cry, I didn\\u2019t want you to know. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I must&amp;#39;ve done something right because that day turned into once a week which turned into whenever you didn\\u2019t have a game or practice. It bled into the summer and you were over often. Me and my friend, the same one who all those months ago all but ran behind me to stop me from following you helped me take the car and you and him and would come over, a \\u201ctwo man\\u201d I guess or whatever. It was fun, we smoked, we drove around. We never really went anywhere but I still wasn\\u2019t too into parties or any of that shit so it didn\\u2019t really matter to me. I was addicted to every part of you and the summer was a haze. I cried and screamed. I pleaded with myself to stop. I knew nothing good would come out of it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That must&amp;#39;ve been the same side of me that told me to walk away back on September 10th. I tried. Fuck. You know I tried, I told you the truth, I cried to my friends about it, I cried to my grandma about it. Yet I just didn\\u2019t know when to quit. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before school ended I saw you walking with her, I was in front of yall and heard the entirety of the conversation. I was pissed for the most part. But I all but prayed it didn\\u2019t go anywhere. We weren\\u2019t anywhere close to being something. I was stupid to hope because now I see you two everywhere. In the process of straightening my schedule out I ended up with the same lunch and now I sit with people I couldn\\u2019t give less of a fuck about as our friendship ran dry years prior and the punishment for doing stupid shit being to watch you talk and walk with her as I sit there in pain while I&amp;#39;m burdened with trying to figure the fuck out how to abort this baby before it\\u2019s too late. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oh I know you remember recent events well. I told you and you looked at me stupid. Accused me of being with other people- well you were not entirely wrong but one of those \\u201cpeople\\u201d was a girl and the other I did no more than make out with. So that shit really hurt. I even in my darkest moment went as far as to attempt to talk to you and see if you had any input, ideas, support even. But no as everything goes you blamed me and made me feel like shit. I grew tired of being so nice to you. I\\u2019ve always been so fucking nice. I told you that I didn\\u2019t care if you were with \\u201cher\\u2019 because she really is a nice girl. I told you I didn\\u2019t want the kid. I told you I\\u2019d keep it since you\\u2019re providing no help with this shit. I don&amp;#39;t want a baby. I cannot have a baby ruin both of our lives. I\\u2019m on track to graduating with an associates degree with still little regard for my mental health and you are quite literally one of the best on our football team. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wouldn\\u2019t want to mess you up..You told me I knew what I was doing, that it was purposeful, you yelled at me. You told me you didn\\u2019t want me when at no point did I even HINT at wanting something more. You broke me. I\\u2019m so stupid I feel numb towards everything and everyone. I haven\\u2019t told my mom I haven\\u2019t done anything yet and I\\u2019m on a timer.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I think I did accomplish one thing though. I don\\u2019t care about you anymore. I feel nothing towards you and don\\u2019t see how I ever found you exciting. You\\u2019re a dumbass jock. I\\u2019m not the type to hold grudges so I release everything now. I know I loved everything about you at some point and the sweet moments we had will always be a part of me. I remember laughing and the times you defended me. I remember when you first showed up to my house rapping a song I now listen to daily. I remember changing myself for you, the conversations in my room. I remember when I first saw you. I also remember wishing you truly saw me. Really saw me and all I had to give you. I won\\u2019t be bitter, I won&amp;#39;t be cruel. I\\u2019ll get rid of it and leave you alone. When I start coming back to school I\\u2019ll stand by these rules. I won\\u2019t bend, I won&amp;#39;t fold. I\\u2019m a completely different person than I was when you were nothing but a voice, a temptation, a fruit I all but finished before realizing how rotten it truly was. You are nobody in this world and neither am I.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 1,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 0.84,\n            \"upVotes\": 4,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/wxvaqx/for_him/\",\n            \"username\": \"FilmAffectionate3711\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_x1lam0\": {\n            \"title\": \"Quietly Yours\",\n            \"body\": \"URL: /r/UnsentLetters/comments/x1la8c/quietly_yours/\\n\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2022-08-30T14:59:11.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"URL: /r/UnsentLetters/comments/x1la8c/quietly_yours/\\n\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 6,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/x1lam0/quietly_yours/\",\n            \"username\": \"Its-Artzie\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_x4jvu6\": {\n            \"title\": \"Period Calligraphy Love Letter Correspondence\",\n            \"body\": \"Hello all,\\n\\nI hope I found the correct subreddit for this.

It's been almost 10 years since I've seen her. I found her email in a directory.\",\n            \"body\": \" *Okay...*\\u00a0hello \\\\[redacted\\\\],  \\n\\n\\nI know I shouldn't do this. That first email I sent you is probably the one thing I regret the most this year, but somehow I find myself here again, feeling the need to bare my soul to you. I'm not sure why, but I'll try to explain it shortly. I've been thinking about you a lot since then, wondering why you didn't reply to the last email. Did you lose all interest once I revealed who I was? Did you find it weird that it came from someone who you've never spoken to? Did you just not remember who I was? Were you going to reply and then something else came up and you forgot to? Or did I make out that last email too much as if it was all a mistake and I didn't care if you replied or not? Admittedly, I really wanted you to, even if it would be a harsh or dismissive response. During that time though, I came up with more things I feel like I have to say to you, and my mind won't let me rest until I say it. So, this email is me saying \\\"*fuck it*\\\". It can't get any worse. I've already embarrassed myself by sending you two, so what's one more for my peace of mind?  \\n\\n\\nFirstly though, I feel like I have to try and explain myself here (*the first email, and whatever the hell it is I'm doing here again*). I have a mental disorder. No, this isn't like when teenage girls get on Twitter, Tik Tok, or *whatever* social media, and claim they're \\\"*bi-polar*\\\" just because they have a few mood swings. I'm diagnosed with an obsessive-compulsive related disorder. I don't want to get into specifics because it is embarrassing... but yea, I basically have OCD. It's hard to explain with words, but in regards to what I'm doing here, it's like... I have these uncontrollable thoughts, sometimes fantasies, sometimes ideas, and it's like... if I don't execute these ideas, then I constantly contemplate obsessively over them for long periods of time. It's not like what I want to do is ever immoral or disingenuous, and it doesn't make my thoughts and feelings any less genuine and sincere, but the issue is, whatever it is I'm thinking of doing, I get fixated on the results that I want, instead of the results that I'm realistically likely to get. For instance, this situation, I know you don't want a *long ass* email from a madman you barely knew in high school rambling on about nonsense, but after wrestling with my mind I decide to send it anyway, because of that 0.0001% chance that you'll see it and reply heartfully, even though it's weird. My mind has been getting lost daily in a fantasy where this whole thing goes exactly the way I want it to, with us becoming pen pals who write 1-2 emails to each other every year or 2, updating one another on the milestones and setbacks in our lives and such. I know it may sound confusing, but it's frustratingly complicated, and to reiterate, difficult for me to explain with words.  \\n\\n\\nI'm also compelled to do this from the fact that I'm never going to see you in person again. To be honest, I take comfort in that fact. But as impulsive and impetuous the decision to write and send you that first email was, I wouldn't have just randomly sent that to just anyone (*well at least I don't think so*). You were my first high school crush. You should already know that. In fact you were probably a lot of people's first '*high school crush*' from our year. I still remember that time at the beginning of summer classes when I walked into that classroom and saw your face for the first time. I was smitten! And you know, I'm from the depths of South Manchester, I'd never seen anyone like you before at that point. You know in those high school movies when a character sees their crush for the first time and everything is suddenly moving in slow motion? That was me! You were like... a star! Not as in \\\"superstar\\\", but like the sun. It was like you were the source of light for that entire\\u00a0room,\\u00a0the entire school even.  \\n\\n\\nWhen the actual school year started, I remember being so fucking ecstatic that you were in my class. I remember staring at you constantly for a while there during the 1st year. I had actually convinced myself that I was going to pluck up the courage to talk to you, and that you had already liked me, and that we were going to be secret lovers (*LO-FUCKING-L*). I'm not sure if that was my mental illness on silent display, or just my narcissism at the time (*I'm willing to bet the latter*), but luckily I didn't have the confidence to say anything to you. Asking you \\\"what time is it?\\\" was all I could manage, but whatever little confidence I had at that point was snuffed out after I let my made up misguiding fantasies lead me into telling \\\\[redacted\\\\] and \\\\[redacted\\\\] (*idk if you'll remember them*) that you liked me (*because of course you noticing me staring you the fuck down meant that you liked me back lol*), to which they both proceeded to laugh in my face upon hearing my absurd claim.  \\n\\n\\nI think they told you about it, I'm not sure because I wasn't there, they just said they would. I was crushed, but it was a much needed wake-up call. I was immature, I was an idiot, I was annoying, I was arrogant, I was a narcissist... maybe I still am. I actually learned a lot from that situation. Though at the time, none of the things I just said about myself, I became self-aware of all that much later in life unfortunately. But back then, I learned a bit about 'classes' and 'leagues' (*as you were way out of mine*), and a bit about my social status being a poor ugly kid with buck teeth and a lisp, in a school with a lot of pretty rich kids with pretty rich parents (*emphasis on \\\"a bit\\\" there*). \\u00a0  \\n\\n\\nSoon after that though... nothing. I surprisingly '*got over it*' quite quickly. Looking back at it now, it feels strange for me to go from being that obsessed with someone and thinking about them all the time, to not caring about them at all or even acknowledging their presence. I mean, you were around for the 4 years I was at that school, and sometime after I even found your Instagram page with the tacky username (*I hope you have a separate work email by the way lol*), but those feelings weren't evoked until that night I started reminiscing about high school days. It makes me wonder, do we actually willingly '*get over*' our infatuations, or do we just bury them all deep deep inside with the likeliness they'll remerge if we ever look at, talk to, be around, or even think about that person for too long? Or..... maybe it's just my OCD. I've just recently started to cope with my mental issues.  \\n\\n\\nI still barely know anything about you and what you've been up to nowadays though, so I thought it would be fun to guess. I imagine you're some kind of business woman. Sales representative or accountant maybe... but not small time, for a big corporation where you will steadily '*climb the ladder*'. I imagine you're the type of girl that plans out their life and has it play out exactly or pretty close to how they wanted it to, because you're dedicated and willing to put in the work to make it so. I imagine you're not married yet, but have an obedient long term boyfriend who knows you well enough to propose at the perfect time. I imagine you're still sociable, and balance your work-life by having weekend nights out with friends to bars, festivals, movies etc., with maybe the one or two one-night-stands here and there (*just to test the waters lol*) because you're the prize in your relationship, not him! I imagine you don't have kids yet either. How old are you now, 26? I imagine you'll be married by 28 and have your first child by 32. And I imagine by then you'll have life sorted out; mortgage paid, your child's college tuition set aside, multiple investments, and you'll feel financially stable enough to take island vacation trips with your family twice a year. But I have no idea if any of that is true or will be, that's just the fantasy version of you that I have in my head. The reality is, I have no idea who you are. For some reason, that makes me sad.  \\n\\n\\nAs for me (*if you're even the least bit interested*), I was catching up with Daniel Dixon on Instagram the other day and I told him my life has been \\\"depressingly sad\\\". Unfortunately, that was me being honest to him. I've been considering writing a book about it... no, like seriously, I've actually been considering it. I guess I'd have to learn how to actually *write* first though. But what does it matter anyway, I feel like I will climb to the top of this roof and jump off of it before I even write a single word.  \\n\\n\\nLove. Always.  \\n\\\\[redacted\\\\]\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2022-08-26T22:19:14.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay...&lt;/em&gt;\\u00a0hello [redacted],  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t do this. That first email I sent you is probably the one thing I regret the most this year, but somehow I find myself here again, feeling the need to bare my soul to you. I&amp;#39;m not sure why, but I&amp;#39;ll try to explain it shortly. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about you a lot since then, wondering why you didn&amp;#39;t reply to the last email. Did you lose all interest once I revealed who I was? Did you find it weird that it came from someone who you&amp;#39;ve never spoken to? Did you just not remember who I was? Were you going to reply and then something else came up and you forgot to? Or did I make out that last email too much as if it was all a mistake and I didn&amp;#39;t care if you replied or not? Admittedly, I really wanted you to, even if it would be a harsh or dismissive response. During that time though, I came up with more things I feel like I have to say to you, and my mind won&amp;#39;t let me rest until I say it. So, this email is me saying &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;fuck it&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. It can&amp;#39;t get any worse. I&amp;#39;ve already embarrassed myself by sending you two, so what&amp;#39;s one more for my peace of mind?  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly though, I feel like I have to try and explain myself here (&lt;em&gt;the first email, and whatever the hell it is I&amp;#39;m doing here again&lt;/em&gt;). I have a mental disorder. No, this isn&amp;#39;t like when teenage girls get on Twitter, Tik Tok, or &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; social media, and claim they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;bi-polar&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; just because they have a few mood swings. I&amp;#39;m diagnosed with an obsessive-compulsive related disorder. I don&amp;#39;t want to get into specifics because it is embarrassing... but yea, I basically have OCD. It&amp;#39;s hard to explain with words, but in regards to what I&amp;#39;m doing here, it&amp;#39;s like... I have these uncontrollable thoughts, sometimes fantasies, sometimes ideas, and it&amp;#39;s like... if I don&amp;#39;t execute these ideas, then I constantly contemplate obsessively over them for long periods of time. It&amp;#39;s not like what I want to do is ever immoral or disingenuous, and it doesn&amp;#39;t make my thoughts and feelings any less genuine and sincere, but the issue is, whatever it is I&amp;#39;m thinking of doing, I get fixated on the results that I want, instead of the results that I&amp;#39;m realistically likely to get. For instance, this situation, I know you don&amp;#39;t want a &lt;em&gt;long ass&lt;/em&gt; email from a madman you barely knew in high school rambling on about nonsense, but after wrestling with my mind I decide to send it anyway, because of that 0.0001% chance that you&amp;#39;ll see it and reply heartfully, even though it&amp;#39;s weird. My mind has been getting lost daily in a fantasy where this whole thing goes exactly the way I want it to, with us becoming pen pals who write 1-2 emails to each other every year or 2, updating one another on the milestones and setbacks in our lives and such. I know it may sound confusing, but it&amp;#39;s frustratingly complicated, and to reiterate, difficult for me to explain with words.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also compelled to do this from the fact that I&amp;#39;m never going to see you in person again. To be honest, I take comfort in that fact. But as impulsive and impetuous the decision to write and send you that first email was, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have just randomly sent that to just anyone (&lt;em&gt;well at least I don&amp;#39;t think so&lt;/em&gt;). You were my first high school crush. You should already know that. In fact you were probably a lot of people&amp;#39;s first &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;high school crush&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39; from our year. I still remember that time at the beginning of summer classes when I walked into that classroom and saw your face for the first time. I was smitten! And you know, I&amp;#39;m from the depths of South Manchester, I&amp;#39;d never seen anyone like you before at that point. You know in those high school movies when a character sees their crush for the first time and everything is suddenly moving in slow motion? That was me! You were like... a star! Not as in &amp;quot;superstar&amp;quot;, but like the sun. It was like you were the source of light for that entire\\u00a0room,\\u00a0the entire school even.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When the actual school year started, I remember being so fucking ecstatic that you were in my class. I remember staring at you constantly for a while there during the 1st year. I had actually convinced myself that I was going to pluck up the courage to talk to you, and that you had already liked me, and that we were going to be secret lovers (&lt;em&gt;LO-FUCKING-L&lt;/em&gt;). I&amp;#39;m not sure if that was my mental illness on silent display, or just my narcissism at the time (&lt;em&gt;I&amp;#39;m willing to bet the latter&lt;/em&gt;), but luckily I didn&amp;#39;t have the confidence to say anything to you. Asking you &amp;quot;what time is it?&amp;quot; was all I could manage, but whatever little confidence I had at that point was snuffed out after I let my made up misguiding fantasies lead me into telling [redacted] and [redacted] (&lt;em&gt;idk if you&amp;#39;ll remember them&lt;/em&gt;) that you liked me (&lt;em&gt;because of course you noticing me staring you the fuck down meant that you liked me back lol&lt;/em&gt;), to which they both proceeded to laugh in my face upon hearing my absurd claim.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I think they told you about it, I&amp;#39;m not sure because I wasn&amp;#39;t there, they just said they would. I was crushed, but it was a much needed wake-up call. I was immature, I was an idiot, I was annoying, I was arrogant, I was a narcissist... maybe I still am. I actually learned a lot from that situation. Though at the time, none of the things I just said about myself, I became self-aware of all that much later in life unfortunately. But back then, I learned a bit about &amp;#39;classes&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;leagues&amp;#39; (&lt;em&gt;as you were way out of mine&lt;/em&gt;), and a bit about my social status being a poor ugly kid with buck teeth and a lisp, in a school with a lot of pretty rich kids with pretty rich parents (&lt;em&gt;emphasis on &amp;quot;a bit&amp;quot; there&lt;/em&gt;). \\u00a0  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Soon after that though... nothing. I surprisingly &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;got over it&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39; quite quickly. Looking back at it now, it feels strange for me to go from being that obsessed with someone and thinking about them all the time, to not caring about them at all or even acknowledging their presence. I mean, you were around for the 4 years I was at that school, and sometime after I even found your Instagram page with the tacky username (&lt;em&gt;I hope you have a separate work email by the way lol&lt;/em&gt;), but those feelings weren&amp;#39;t evoked until that night I started reminiscing about high school days. It makes me wonder, do we actually willingly &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;get over&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39; our infatuations, or do we just bury them all deep deep inside with the likeliness they&amp;#39;ll remerge if we ever look at, talk to, be around, or even think about that person for too long? Or..... maybe it&amp;#39;s just my OCD. I&amp;#39;ve just recently started to cope with my mental issues.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I still barely know anything about you and what you&amp;#39;ve been up to nowadays though, so I thought it would be fun to guess. I imagine you&amp;#39;re some kind of business woman. Sales representative or accountant maybe... but not small time, for a big corporation where you will steadily &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;climb the ladder&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;. I imagine you&amp;#39;re the type of girl that plans out their life and has it play out exactly or pretty close to how they wanted it to, because you&amp;#39;re dedicated and willing to put in the work to make it so. I imagine you&amp;#39;re not married yet, but have an obedient long term boyfriend who knows you well enough to propose at the perfect time. I imagine you&amp;#39;re still sociable, and balance your work-life by having weekend nights out with friends to bars, festivals, movies etc., with maybe the one or two one-night-stands here and there (&lt;em&gt;just to test the waters lol&lt;/em&gt;) because you&amp;#39;re the prize in your relationship, not him! I imagine you don&amp;#39;t have kids yet either. How old are you now, 26? I imagine you&amp;#39;ll be married by 28 and have your first child by 32. And I imagine by then you&amp;#39;ll have life sorted out; mortgage paid, your child&amp;#39;s college tuition set aside, multiple investments, and you&amp;#39;ll feel financially stable enough to take island vacation trips with your family twice a year.

You certainly know your way around a man's brain and know how to hook them. I fell for every single bit like an idiot so it's my own fault. Going by your platform and dating history you've learned it pretty well.\\nYou can pretend you're just innocently looking for friends but you know you enjoyed getting me into you. Was it fun for you to turn someone's head that was meant to be on a break? \\n\\nYou won't admit that, you won't even realise that, but it's the truth.\\n\\nThat night I bombarded your WhatsApp (I'll admit I was pretty crazy, I had had a lot to drink but it isn't an excuse so I apologise) you said, and I quote, \\\"Can we please talk about this in the morning. Like normal human beings please? I don't want us to fall out. Because surprisingly you mean a lot to me.\\\"\\nI then asked you to explain 'last night', very rationally, and you played dumb.

And you absolutely did not have feelings for me, let alone falling for me.\\nAgain, my own fault for falling for your bullshit but shame on you for saying things I wanted, maybe even needed, to hear when you knew I was at a low point. You can't convince me otherwise.\\n\\nIt will probably bring you joy and I'll hate myself for saying this. But if there is goodness in you, you have seriously hurt and embarrassed me.\\n\\nYou can feel good about yourself by telling people they can reach out to you but you should feel bad for how you've made me feel. I reached out to you to see if you were okay. And you've made me feel this way for absolutely fucking nothing. Really think about it. It was for nothing. Don't tell someone you like them when you're chasing for their friends. Don't tell someone you're there for them then ignore and block them. Don't tell someone you're falling for them then intentionally trigger the two things you know they hate the most. Don't tell someone you'll talk about it the next day then pretend it didn't happen.\\n\\nYou said a bunch of shit then hid. Texting me the same night asking to be friends and not to fall out. Messaging the following morning asking if we're still friends then ignoring the fact you said you'd talk about it the next day. I was having a god damn breakdown and it's nothing to you.\\n\\nA friend? Fuck that and fuck you too.\\n\\nIf you actually gave a fuck about me you would have made the smallest attempt to resolve it.

But you&amp;#39;ve told me countless times about guys DMing you and the dates you go on. Even this guitar guy writing you songs and asking you on dates. Constantly posting thirsty shit and asking strangers to contact you in any way. I tell you about an ex and boom I&amp;#39;m a cunt. It&amp;#39;s extremely hypocritical. Apparently putting you third when you were first the entire time. You put yourself beyond last. Over literally nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite knowing I&amp;#39;m extremely jealous you still would ask strangers to reach out, you knew exactly what it would do to me and did it anyway.

We\\u2019d stayed up till late sprawled in my bed in varying states of undress. We\\u2019d done our due amount of sex and kissing \\u2013 till there was only the talking left and that is what we do: talk the same dialect of nonsense. The lamp is off, we\\u2019re bleary-eyed and you\\u2019ve complained about my \\u2018loud blinking\\u2019. You turn over and I press my chest against your back. I rest my hand on the groove of your side. \\n\\n\\u2018What would you do if I peed in your fridge?\\u2019 You mumbled that \\u2013 or something to the same effect of lunacy and impossibility. \\u2018I\\u2019d suck your dick\\u2019 I mutter back \\u2013 or something to the same effect of dismissal and placation. We go around a couple of times and you go quiet and I assume that you\\u2019ve decided that you are done for the night, struggled to think of absurd situations of my own but admitted defeat to my fatigue and then you say: \\u2018What would you do if I proposed to you?\\u2019 and you knock all of the air out of my body. \\n\\nSuddenly I was a child again \\u2013 mouth agape as I look up at my mother, hand buried deep in the peanut butter jar, legs outstretched on the ground. \\n\\nMy first instinct is the desperate search for a lie but you\\u2019d caught me off guard. Or maybe I am incredibly weak and the sound of your voice reduces me to infirmity. You must have felt my heart jumpstart in my chest like an old boat engine. Hand in the jar. Mouth agape. I wonder if I only imagined the strange sincerity in your tone. \\n\\n\\u2018I would say yes\\u2019 felt like the worst possible thing to say \\u2013 I might as well have given you my passport and my debit card and my keys and the original copy of my birth cert. Incredulous at myself, I tried to fabricate some scenario in which my reply had been part of an elaborate comedic *bit*. So that I could undo myself.  So that I could undo the big gaudy slice of myself you had inexorably coaxed out of me. \\n\\nThe truth was that I had been stopping outside of jewellery store windows to stare at wedding rings. The truth was that I spent every moment apart from you trying \\u2013 against my will, god dammit \\u2013 to recreate the experience of you. The truth was that you\\u2019ve reduced me into this stumbling creature that sings along to love songs and cries at airport chase scenes and covets the scent of your laundry detergent. You\\u2019ve made me unproductive, unrealistic, illogical, and incredibly stupid and you occupy all my time and imagination and the thought of you on one knee looking up at me with those big stupid eyes is something so large and dizzying that the very act of materialising it with your voice should register as a crime against humanity.\\n\\n\\u2018Really?\\u2019 was all you managed, and I started, pathetically, to amend my answer and I tell you that I am just at am impulsive stage of my life and implying that it was not, at all, the case that I was desperately and terrifyingly in love with you.  And the more I continued to explain this the more I deflate at the obvious lie and the anticipation of your reaction. It was supposed to be a secret. Remember that you forced it out of me. Remember that and have some mercy. I feel myself sinking, sinking, spinning. \\n\\n\\u2018That scares me, honestly,\\u2019 you said in response, but you turn back towards me and I look down \\u2018, I wouldn\\u2019t want to jump into a marriage straight away\\u2019 \\u2018Then don\\u2019t propose to me.\\u2019 I\\u2019d meant to say it light-heartedly but it came out pointed, betraying my hurt. I\\u2019ve never been good at pretending to be anything and am often disappointed in my inability to appear unaffected. (I am often very deeply affected). \\u2018You\\u2019d get bored, I bet. I bet you\\u2019d cheat on me after the first year of marriage.\\u2019 You said, wrapping your arms around me. I lean into the warmth of your body. I\\u2019ve told you about the deadliness of your voice; here you are building sandcastles out of words. The thought of our marriage \\u2013 the idea of it \\u2013 existing in your head. As a premise to a downfall.

We\\u2019d stayed up till late sprawled in my bed in varying states of undress. We\\u2019d done our due amount of sex and kissing \\u2013 till there was only the talking left and that is what we do: talk the same dialect of nonsense. The lamp is off, we\\u2019re bleary-eyed and you\\u2019ve complained about my \\u2018loud blinking\\u2019. You turn over and I press my chest against your back. I rest my hand on the groove of your side. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;\\u2018What would you do if I peed in your fridge?\\u2019 You mumbled that \\u2013 or something to the same effect of lunacy and impossibility. \\u2018I\\u2019d suck your dick\\u2019 I mutter back \\u2013 or something to the same effect of dismissal and placation. We go around a couple of times and you go quiet and I assume that you\\u2019ve decided that you are done for the night, struggled to think of absurd situations of my own but admitted defeat to my fatigue and then you say: \\u2018What would you do if I proposed to you?\\u2019 and you knock all of the air out of my body. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I was a child again \\u2013 mouth agape as I look up at my mother, hand buried deep in the peanut butter jar, legs outstretched on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My first instinct is the desperate search for a lie but you\\u2019d caught me off guard. Or maybe I am incredibly weak and the sound of your voice reduces me to infirmity. You must have felt my heart jumpstart in my chest like an old boat engine. Hand in the jar. Mouth agape. I wonder if I only imagined the strange sincerity in your tone. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;\\u2018I would say yes\\u2019 felt like the worst possible thing to say \\u2013 I might as well have given you my passport and my debit card and my keys and the original copy of my birth cert. Incredulous at myself, I tried to fabricate some scenario in which my reply had been part of an elaborate comedic &lt;em&gt;bit&lt;/em&gt;. So that I could undo myself.  So that I could undo the big gaudy slice of myself you had inexorably coaxed out of me. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The truth was that I had been stopping outside of jewellery store windows to stare at wedding rings. The truth was that I spent every moment apart from you trying \\u2013 against my will, god dammit \\u2013 to recreate the experience of you. The truth was that you\\u2019ve reduced me into this stumbling creature that sings along to love songs and cries at airport chase scenes and covets the scent of your laundry detergent. You\\u2019ve made me unproductive, unrealistic, illogical, and incredibly stupid and you occupy all my time and imagination and the thought of you on one knee looking up at me with those big stupid eyes is something so large and dizzying that the very act of materialising it with your voice should register as a crime against humanity.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;\\u2018Really?\\u2019 was all you managed, and I started, pathetically, to amend my answer and I tell you that I am just at am impulsive stage of my life and implying that it was not, at all, the case that I was desperately and terrifyingly in love with you.  And the more I continued to explain this the more I deflate at the obvious lie and the anticipation of your reaction. It was supposed to be a secret. Remember that you forced it out of me. Remember that and have some mercy. I feel myself sinking, sinking, spinning. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;\\u2018That scares me, honestly,\\u2019 you said in response, but you turn back towards me and I look down \\u2018, I wouldn\\u2019t want to jump into a marriage straight away\\u2019 \\u2018Then don\\u2019t propose to me.\\u2019 I\\u2019d meant to say it light-heartedly but it came out pointed, betraying my hurt. I\\u2019ve never been good at pretending to be anything and am often disappointed in my inability to appear unaffected. (I am often very deeply affected). \\u2018You\\u2019d get bored, I bet. I bet you\\u2019d cheat on me after the first year of marriage.\\u2019 You said, wrapping your arms around me. I lean into the warmth of your body. I\\u2019ve told you about the deadliness of your voice; here you are building sandcastles out of words. The thought of our marriage \\u2013 the idea of it \\u2013 existing in your head. As a premise to a downfall. As a millisecond. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;\\u2018Hmm, maybe I would.\\u2019 I said, sighing happily. \\u2018Well, I\\u2019m not proposing to you any time soon so don\\u2019t get your hopes up\\u2019 and you kiss me on the forehead and that was truly the end of the night.

There is something about you that is more comfortable than comfort, stronger than strength, and deeper than what I\\u2019ve come to expect from ordinary interactions. Like that old scene in The Wizard of Oz, when I\\u2019m with you I feel like I\\u2019ve been lifted from the Kansas of my youth to a world of magic only to find out, finally, that there is even more to it, some force behind the curtains pulling the levers when for most people there are no curtains or force at all.

I bet each of your friends would say the same thing. Yet even as you are a bottomless cup to take in the world, you yourself are constantly overflowing. Take it from an introvert like myself: it\\u2019s admirable that you\\u2019re so regularly compelled to check your experiences with your friends and seek their feedback. \\u201cI wanted a male and female perspective on this thing.\\u201d I love that about you. For all your sense of direction, you still make sure to stop and check that you\\u2019re going the right way.\\n\\nI want you to know how I feel because at root I agree with you that this \\u201cthing\\u201d between us isn\\u2019t going to and shouldn\\u2019t lead to anything more than its current \\u201cthing\\u201dness. We both deserve to be with someone long term who shares our family and life values, you especially deserve to be with someone who has worked equally hard in crafting his faith to be a bedrock motivation for all he does in the world. And yet it remains that I\\u2019ve come to think very fondly, very lovingly, even, of you, and if we can\\u2019t chase our feelings down whatever rabbit hole they\\u2019re beckoning us towards, we can at least shine a brighter light on them so that, looking back, we know we weren\\u2019t deceived.\\n\\nI really do have a lot of love \\u201cfor you\\u201d. And to the extent that passionate, honeymoon period-type feelings equate to real feelings, I have no problem saying that I love you. You are a beautiful woman (and a babe to top it off), but more than that you have a beautiful soul, and that\\u2019s why I don\\u2019t feel too creepy or overbearing in saying such a thing. I think anyone who takes you seriously would come to think of you with a feeling of love. But this is especially important to me because, as I\\u2019ve alluded to, I had a nasty breakup in my last relationship and, truth be told, the anger and bitterness I even now still feel from it have been, maybe to the same extend as my work travels, a major source of why I haven\\u2019t found a new relationship. So it\\u2019s with some major grace \\u2013 as you might say \\u2013 that I\\u2019ve met someone who I could easily see myself dating and with whom, if things were right, I would risk again falling in love.\\n\\nBut things aren\\u2019t right; our parachutes have already been pulled to stop that sort of falling. And in two months I won\\u2019t be around nearly as often as I am now. So I don\\u2019t think any of this is too, too big of a deal. I would view our \\u201cthing\\u201d as a success if we could see each other here and there until my lease is up and, from then, if we could cheer each other on with every new turn in life \\u2013 job changes, moves, and eventually, serious partners. It will be enough for me to know that what we felt was real even if it wasn\\u2019t meant to be and to know that you knew how I felt.\\n\\nIn summary, our love is like the planetary status of Pluto: technically yes, but only for a while. It never even made a full rotation around the sun.\\n\\nHere\\u2019s to me be thinkin\\u2019 bout chu,\\n\\nMuch love,\\n\\nAaron\\n\\n\\\\-----\\n\\nAaron,\\n\\nYour words are very dear to me. I feel overwhelmingly grateful to have such lovely words written about our time together, and I will cherish them. It has taken me a while to come around to the difficult reality that we care enough about one another to let each other go. There is something in me that jumps up to object when I think of never being next to you again, but with time and practice I will be able to look on us only with fondness.\\n\\nI have felt loved by you and wish I could convey how dear you have become to me in other ways than a manifesto-sequel letter. I would rather show you slowly over many moons of companionship and trips to foreign places and secret exchanges under covers. I am sorry I am not better at offering up my friendship to you in lieu of all these things \\u2013 from the first time I saw you I felt your magnetic pull and I\\u2019m quite certain it\\u2019s here to stay.\\n\\nThe more I learned the mind behind those effortlessly weaponized eyes, the less I have been able to control my compounding feelings for you. Your capacity to love and communicate love is uncommonly beautiful, and I hope you know how precious I have counted the moments spent on its receiving end.\\n\\nYour passion for stretching your mind and pushing your body past its perceived limits is not only admirable, but serves as a projection of the core strength you possess. You sharpen your mind and body as you do your character \\u2013 and this relentless desire to learn and grow will never allow you to reach a final state of being as so many do. I love this drive in you; the battle against complacency and respect for discomfort are much more than many are willing to submit to for growth. I know it is one of the many special things that will make you an exemplary husband and father. This strength in you can be hard to oppose, so choose your battles wisely with those you love, but never let it dull for anything or anyone.\\n\\nI do want to take up space to apologize for not caring for you and respecting you in the ways you so deserve. There was always a shadowed gap between how I treated you and how I wanted to treat you. And in that place it was always raining, overcrowded with thoughts and feelings, and altogether a bit chaotic. I like to imagine our world without that place. We never got there but I know it\\u2019d be sunny, even with all the big ginkgo trees, and somewhere underneath you\\u2019re sipping your coffee and holding my feet.\\n\\nI don\\u2019t know the coordinates of how or when you snuck your way into my heart, but you should know that in the capacity for which we allowed \\u2013 and even for some we didn\\u2019t \\u2013 I love you. Even in the midst of a contradiction so grand that there was a large wall in between the way we see the world, I could not help but press up onto my tippy toes for just another small glimpse at you, one more passing moment, a further chance to reach over and pull you to me again. How I am going to miss you.\\n\\nI can\\u2019t wait to cheer you on from afar at every triumphant turn ahead of you, Aaron. Orbiting around the other \\u201creal planets\\u201d with you is something I will always cherish. And you\\u2019re right, we were real too. Please know that I am one of your biggest fans, and I will always be praying for you and that treasure of a soul you have. I hope this is a launch pad for a great big love coming your way \\u2013 the forever kind \\u2013 and I hope it feels like one big exhale of \\u201cah, I\\u2019m home\\u201d.

For all your sense of direction, you still make sure to stop and check that you\\u2019re going the right way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I want you to know how I feel because at root I agree with you that this \\u201cthing\\u201d between us isn\\u2019t going to and shouldn\\u2019t lead to anything more than its current \\u201cthing\\u201dness. We both deserve to be with someone long term who shares our family and life values, you especially deserve to be with someone who has worked equally hard in crafting his faith to be a bedrock motivation for all he does in the world. And yet it remains that I\\u2019ve come to think very fondly, very lovingly, even, of you, and if we can\\u2019t chase our feelings down whatever rabbit hole they\\u2019re beckoning us towards, we can at least shine a brighter light on them so that, looking back, we know we weren\\u2019t deceived.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I really do have a lot of love \\u201cfor you\\u201d. And to the extent that passionate, honeymoon period-type feelings equate to real feelings, I have no problem saying that I love you. You are a beautiful woman (and a babe to top it off), but more than that you have a beautiful soul, and that\\u2019s why I don\\u2019t feel too creepy or overbearing in saying such a thing. I think anyone who takes you seriously would come to think of you with a feeling of love. But this is especially important to me because, as I\\u2019ve alluded to, I had a nasty breakup in my last relationship and, truth be told, the anger and bitterness I even now still feel from it have been, maybe to the same extend as my work travels, a major source of why I haven\\u2019t found a new relationship. So it\\u2019s with some major grace \\u2013 as you might say \\u2013 that I\\u2019ve met someone who I could easily see myself dating and with whom, if things were right, I would risk again falling in love.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But things aren\\u2019t right; our parachutes have already been pulled to stop that sort of falling. And in two months I won\\u2019t be around nearly as often as I am now. So I don\\u2019t think any of this is too, too big of a deal. I would view our \\u201cthing\\u201d as a success if we could see each other here and there until my lease is up and, from then, if we could cheer each other on with every new turn in life \\u2013 job changes, moves, and eventually, serious partners. It will be enough for me to know that what we felt was real even if it wasn\\u2019t meant to be and to know that you knew how I felt.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In summary, our love is like the planetary status of Pluto: technically yes, but only for a while. It never even made a full rotation around the sun.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here\\u2019s to me be thinkin\\u2019 bout chu,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Much love,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Aaron&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;-----&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Aaron,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Your words are very dear to me. I feel overwhelmingly grateful to have such lovely words written about our time together, and I will cherish them. It has taken me a while to come around to the difficult reality that we care enough about one another to let each other go. There is something in me that jumps up to object when I think of never being next to you again, but with time and practice I will be able to look on us only with fondness.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have felt loved by you and wish I could convey how dear you have become to me in other ways than a manifesto-sequel letter. I would rather show you slowly over many moons of companionship and trips to foreign places and secret exchanges under covers. I am sorry I am not better at offering up my friendship to you in lieu of all these things \\u2013 from the first time I saw you I felt your magnetic pull and I\\u2019m quite certain it\\u2019s here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The more I learned the mind behind those effortlessly weaponized eyes, the less I have been able to control my compounding feelings for you. Your capacity to love and communicate love is uncommonly beautiful, and I hope you know how precious I have counted the moments spent on its receiving end.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Your passion for stretching your mind and pushing your body past its perceived limits is not only admirable, but serves as a projection of the core strength you possess. You sharpen your mind and body as you do your character \\u2013 and this relentless desire to learn and grow will never allow you to reach a final state of being as so many do. I love this drive in you; the battle against complacency and respect for discomfort are much more than many are willing to submit to for growth. I know it is one of the many special things that will make you an exemplary husband and father. This strength in you can be hard to oppose, so choose your battles wisely with those you love, but never let it dull for anything or anyone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I do want to take up space to apologize for not caring for you and respecting you in the ways you so deserve. There was always a shadowed gap between how I treated you and how I wanted to treat you. And in that place it was always raining, overcrowded with thoughts and feelings, and altogether a bit chaotic. I like to imagine our world without that place. We never got there but I know it\\u2019d be sunny, even with all the big ginkgo trees, and somewhere underneath you\\u2019re sipping your coffee and holding my feet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don\\u2019t know the coordinates of how or when you snuck your way into my heart, but you should know that in the capacity for which we allowed \\u2013 and even for some we didn\\u2019t \\u2013 I love you. Even in the midst of a contradiction so grand that there was a large wall in between the way we see the world, I could not help but press up onto my tippy toes for just another small glimpse at you, one more passing moment, a further chance to reach over and pull you to me again. How I am going to miss you.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can\\u2019t wait to cheer you on from afar at every triumphant turn ahead of you, Aaron. Orbiting around the other \\u201creal planets\\u201d with you is something I will always cherish. And you\\u2019re right, we were real too. Please know that I am one of your biggest fans, and I will always be praying for you and that treasure of a soul you have. I hope this is a launch pad for a great big love coming your way \\u2013 the forever kind \\u2013 and I hope it feels like one big exhale of \\u201cah, I\\u2019m home\\u201d. Thank you for sweet glimpses of that. I\\u2019ll be seeing you under the trees.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I do be thinkin\\u2019 bout you too doe,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Love always,&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Julia&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 0.92,\n            \"upVotes\": 9,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/vm465s/our_love_is_like_the_planetary_status_of_pluto/\",\n            \"username\": \"foxy_cleopatra_9\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_vohe0j\": {\n            \"title\": \"Laura, get a grip\",\n            \"body\": \"I love you!

We were paranoid and laughing driving in circles till i got to really see you the following day. I remember being nervous, but more excited than anything. I parked and walked with you inside looking at you quickly so you wouldn't notice me falling in love with you. You looked too I could feel your eyes on me from time to time. We stepped into the elevator and you hit 3. I remember thinking omg this is it! As we exited the elevator i got that super dizzy feeling after getting off elevators, but it was so much more intense. I told you that elevator makes me dizzy, but honestly it was you that made me almost crash into the wall. You opened the door and everything looked perfect. I still remember the way you smelled and the kiss that sucked the anxiety out of me. You layed back on the bed and played yellow. I laid down next to you and kissed you more and harder until I felt I could no longer resist the temptation any longer. We had talked for months everyday almost all day and night, we called, we listened to each other and built the strongest bond I ever had for anyone. I never knew someone like you existed. As I pulled off your pants and boxers my mouth watered with temptation and pure desire to make you feel how much i loved you. I licked and kissed and sucked until I finally got to taste every drop of you. I licked my lips and said,  \\\"I told you!\\\" You pulled me towards you and we kissed intensely and passionately, it didn't seem that long, but time flew that day. Then you took your magical hands and knew the softness and pressure in each area as I moaned and grabbed a pillow. Inside and out, then you knew the right moment to start putting more pressure in all the right places down there! After you made me go I could barely breathe and drank so much water, like I was dying in the desert heat. I was amazed, satisfied, tingly, and the happiest I've felt in my life, but you have to understand the emotional bond that happened first for months and months before all this. I was able to trust, open up, relax, and just feel the love in each touch you gave me. We talked, listened to music, felt up each other, kissed more, laughed, and that's when I noticed your eyes, they were the most beautiful color i have ever seen. I asked you if you knew your eyes changed colors and you said yeah kinda, depends what I'm wearing. I said no no no! This whole time I didn't notice your eyes getting brighter and brighter! It's not a color I can quite explain because they weren't hazel, not light brown, just a color with no known name in the English dictionary. It was almost like a very light colored cherry wood, but bright and I swear I could see your soul shining out into mine. I know most people won't believe this, but that's ok because I seen it and know it's true. It's my favorite color even with no name, but I don't care. It makes it all the more special to me. I've heard the saying that the eyes are windows to the soul, but honestly never seen it like that!! I could see behind the bright glow that there were dark brown areas and wondered what it meant. I had a pretty good idea, but never brought it up. I was just happy to replace the dark brown spots with the magic glow. You made me feel like the most beautiful person in the world, you made me feel special, but most importantly you loved the real me. See no one had ever seen me without my mask that I hide behind. You are the only one and that's why I don't care about anything but loving you and being with you the rest of my life. There is nothing you could do that would ever change my mind. Even through the bad times all I could do was cry and yearn for you. I realized as long as you were with me, I didn't care about physical pain, because the emotional pain of not having you was so much worse and I just couldn't deal with that. If one of us is going out than I don't think either one of us could keep on going. I know I couldn't and yes I might be fucked up, but this is my life and I like the way you make me feel and the way we obsess over each other. I'll never listen to a jealous lover who lies to get you back in her reach, by scaring me and making me leave. I'll never leave you ever again, I promise on us baby!

This whole time I didn&amp;#39;t notice your eyes getting brighter and brighter! It&amp;#39;s not a color I can quite explain because they weren&amp;#39;t hazel, not light brown, just a color with no known name in the English dictionary. It was almost like a very light colored cherry wood, but bright and I swear I could see your soul shining out into mine. I know most people won&amp;#39;t believe this, but that&amp;#39;s ok because I seen it and know it&amp;#39;s true. It&amp;#39;s my favorite color even with no name, but I don&amp;#39;t care. It makes it all the more special to me. I&amp;#39;ve heard the saying that the eyes are windows to the soul, but honestly never seen it like that!! I could see behind the bright glow that there were dark brown areas and wondered what it meant. I had a pretty good idea, but never brought it up. I was just happy to replace the dark brown spots with the magic glow. You made me feel like the most beautiful person in the world, you made me feel special, but most importantly you loved the real me. See no one had ever seen me without my mask that I hide behind. You are the only one and that&amp;#39;s why I don&amp;#39;t care about anything but loving you and being with you the rest of my life. There is nothing you could do that would ever change my mind. Even through the bad times all I could do was cry and yearn for you. I realized as long as you were with me, I didn&amp;#39;t care about physical pain, because the emotional pain of not having you was so much worse and I just couldn&amp;#39;t deal with that. If one of us is going out than I don&amp;#39;t think either one of us could keep on going. I know I couldn&amp;#39;t and yes I might be fucked up, but this is my life and I like the way you make me feel and the way we obsess over each other. I&amp;#39;ll never listen to a jealous lover who lies to get you back in her reach, by scaring me and making me leave. I&amp;#39;ll never leave you ever again, I promise on us baby!

You probably didn't see this coming (but if i were you i would have \\\\*at least\\\\* suspected it) I've tried to keep this in for a \\\\*very\\\\* long time, but i don't know if i can anymore. I've realized that i might as well be honest with you, because i honestly don't see any better thing to do here. I mean it when i say i've never told anyone anything like this before and i just ask you to understand where i'm coming from and don't think i'm crazy...\\n\\nI wanted to tell you that i love you, and no, i don't quite understand it myself. My feelings for you are much too strong for the amount we talk. Come to think of it, my feelings for you are much too strong even for the amount we \\\\*used to\\\\* talk. But it is what it is... So i'd like to attempt to explain myself to you.\\n\\nFirst off. I've always seen you as someone whose social life is \\\\*at least\\\\* a 4 or 5 out of 10... and probably more than that. Unlike myself, I'd assume you have at least one or two friends in real life, and at least just as many online friends you know better than me. of course, you also have a girlfriend who i assume does more with \\\\*you\\\\* than send you repetitive emoticons and filler compliments. I can't say the same about any of that.\\n\\nWhile on the other hand, my frequent complaints about my social life to you and on statuses you may or may not have seen are certainly no exaggeration. My entire life, i've had all of two friends, of which you have by far been the best. I've never known anyone outside of my family in real life, either. So while something like this may seem like a side thing to a normal person, it's all i've ever known.\\n\\nNow, i'm not sure where to go next, perhaps now that i've gotten out of the way why i'm \\\\*capable\\\\* of liking you so much, i should get on with why i \\\\*do\\\\* like you so much.\\n\\nI don't see how i couldn't, honestly! I've always looked up to you as an amazing and wonderful person, and i would describe you as better than me in every way. Sure, i know you have issues as you have discussed them with me and in servers we have both been in in the past. But to me, that doesn't make you any less perfect, everyone has their problems, i know i do. Which is another reason i love you, you, unlike almost anyone else, have always been there for me. I don't know if you've ever liked me as a friend even a little bit, or if you just figured nobody else was going to talk to me. You're the only person who's ever even attempted to understand me, no matter how small and/or petty i have found my problems at times. i am not exaggerating when saying that i wouldn't be alive right now if i had never met you. You're the only person i enjoy talking to, and for some reason i find myself thinking about you every day. I don't know how or why exactly, but i know for a fact i love you. \\n\\nNext, i would like to clarify that i am \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*not\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* asking to date you in any way shape or form, i know better than that, i may be too stupid to score above a C in high school, but i'm not so stupid as to ask you to be with me. I don't even see myself as good enough to be a real friend to you! let alone anything more than that. and while that fact does hurt me, it's entirely my fault, and entirely my responsibility. You don't have to tell me that's not an option, i already full well understand that.\\n\\nThe day i realized how strongly i felt for you was October 29, 2021. We listened to music in a voice chat that day, and at the time you had recently returned from a 3 month long absence off this website. but once we started talking again, it felt like you were never gone. I felt better than i had in \\\\*very\\\\* a long time back then. Every time i've ever seen you hurt, it's hurt me greatly (no joke, no exaggeration), and it's hurt me even worse that i couldn't ever do anything about it for you. \\\\*I could never give back to you for what you've gave to me.\\\\*\\n\\nand finally, i wanted to inform you that i have removed you from my friends list. This also hurts me as you are the last, and i mean last, person i want to remove from my friends list. But i don't know if i'm in the mental state right now to worry about your response to this. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*If you're not angered by this, i would LOVE for you to add me back\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*, and we can get things back to normal and maybe talk a little about this!\\n\\nI'm real sorry... i didn't want to do this, i didn't want to tell you this, but i can't keep it to myself anymore, it's really beginning to affect me.\\n\\nAgain, I'm not asking for you to love me back, or date me, or even pretend to date me. I only ask that you're not mad at me, that you don't think i'm a creep, and maybe even understand where i'm coming from. I really wish we can still be friends after this and it would be a great loss to me if this is it. Of course, i understand if you never want to speak to me again, and i even understand if you hate me because of this. I'm sorry\\n\\nPlease add me back if you're not mad at me! i'll be happy to continue being your friend and answer any more questions you might have. I can't say i'm sorry enough. I'm almost crying right now thinking that i've made a terrible mistake...\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2022-05-11T07:15:51.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\\\"md\\\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! i&amp;#39;m new to this subreddit and unfortunately i don&amp;#39;t know where else to ask for help with this but i&amp;#39;ll try and make my explanation brief.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m asking for help with a love confession letter to my best friend (we are both already taken and we only know each other online, however). and i&amp;#39;d like to make it clear to them that my love is 100% wholesome, i still want to be friends with them, and also that i&amp;#39;m &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; asking to be in a relationship with them. and i&amp;#39;d like some help with that! :)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is what i have in mind so far:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hey... i&amp;#39;m sorry to bother you... i just wanted to tell you something i think it&amp;#39;s way past time i told you.

But to me, that doesn&amp;#39;t make you any less perfect, everyone has their problems, i know i do. Which is another reason i love you, you, unlike almost anyone else, have always been there for me. I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve ever liked me as a friend even a little bit, or if you just figured nobody else was going to talk to me. You&amp;#39;re the only person who&amp;#39;s ever even attempted to understand me, no matter how small and/or petty i have found my problems at times. i am not exaggerating when saying that i wouldn&amp;#39;t be alive right now if i had never met you. You&amp;#39;re the only person i enjoy talking to, and for some reason i find myself thinking about you every day. I don&amp;#39;t know how or why exactly, but i know for a fact i love you. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Next, i would like to clarify that i am ***not*** asking to date you in any way shape or form, i know better than that, i may be too stupid to score above a C in high school, but i&amp;#39;m not so stupid as to ask you to be with me. I don&amp;#39;t even see myself as good enough to be a real friend to you! let alone anything more than that. and while that fact does hurt me, it&amp;#39;s entirely my fault, and entirely my responsibility. You don&amp;#39;t have to tell me that&amp;#39;s not an option, i already full well understand that.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The day i realized how strongly i felt for you was October 29, 2021. We listened to music in a voice chat that day, and at the time you had recently returned from a 3 month long absence off this website. but once we started talking again, it felt like you were never gone. I felt better than i had in *very* a long time back then. Every time i&amp;#39;ve ever seen you hurt, it&amp;#39;s hurt me greatly (no joke, no exaggeration), and it&amp;#39;s hurt me even worse that i couldn&amp;#39;t ever do anything about it for you. *I could never give back to you for what you&amp;#39;ve gave to me.*&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;and finally, i wanted to inform you that i have removed you from my friends list. This also hurts me as you are the last, and i mean last, person i want to remove from my friends list. But i don&amp;#39;t know if i&amp;#39;m in the mental state right now to worry about your response to this. ***If you&amp;#39;re not angered by this, i would LOVE for you to add me back***, and we can get things back to normal and maybe talk a little about this!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m real sorry... i didn&amp;#39;t want to do this, i didn&amp;#39;t want to tell you this, but i can&amp;#39;t keep it to myself anymore, it&amp;#39;s really beginning to affect me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Again, I&amp;#39;m not asking for you to love me back, or date me, or even pretend to date me. I only ask that you&amp;#39;re not mad at me, that you don&amp;#39;t think i&amp;#39;m a creep, and maybe even understand where i&amp;#39;m coming from. I really wish we can still be friends after this and it would be a great loss to me if this is it. Of course, i understand if you never want to speak to me again, and i even understand if you hate me because of this. I&amp;#39;m sorry&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Please add me back if you&amp;#39;re not mad at me! i&amp;#39;ll be happy to continue being your friend and answer any more questions you might have. I can&amp;#39;t say i&amp;#39;m sorry enough. I&amp;#39;m almost crying right now thinking that i&amp;#39;ve made a terrible mistake...&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 2,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/un41iw/asking_for_help_with_a_love_confession_letter/\",\n            \"username\": \"Shot_District775\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_uf3qw5\": {\n            \"title\": \"To Whom it May Concern\",\n            \"body\": \"Recently had training for work in another state with other coworkers from around the country.

Maybe I was still a bit tipsy off wine, or maybe it was intoxicating enough to be around you. \\n\\nThere was something so different about you and I loved it. You made me feel butterflies I didn\\u2019t normally feel\\u2014 you were supposed to be another man I had a fun night with, not a lover I lost. \\n\\nThat\\u2019s what it feels like sometimes, like I lost you. Our world turned upside down and there was nothing anybody could do about it. One moment we were walking down the frozen dark streets of the city- laughing, chatting, kissing- and then the next week the city streets were bare, and we hadn\\u2019t spoken a word to one another since our petty argument. \\n\\nI like to think about a time where the world stayed right side up, at least long enough for us to have made something out of whatever it was we were becoming. \\n\\nDo you think we would\\u2019ve worked out? Part of me yearns to hear a yes from your lips, the same ones that took my breath away when you kissed me. One time, we were laying in your bed together. I was squished in between you and the wall, happily looking up at you. We started talking about bad kissers\\u2026 \\n\\n*\\u201cSome people are just bad at kissing!\\u201d* You exclaimed, smiling. \\n\\nI agreed, but had to push your buttons- *\\u201cI think some people just kiss differently, I don\\u2019t think you can intentionally be good or bad.\\u201d*\\n\\nI smiled then, because I was going to get what I wanted. \\n\\nYou kissed me. Sloppily, closely, simply. *\\u201cNow was that good?\\u201d*\\n\\nI opened my mouth to reply, but before I could you leaned in and kissed me again. I didn\\u2019t quite realize how good you really were at kissing until that moment you kissed me with so much passion and intention that you left me breathless. \\n\\nI wish I could get one more kiss like that from you, sometimes. \\n\\nI feel guilty writing all of this, telling you how much I miss and yearn for you. I have someone I love dearly, more than I think I loved you in those moments you swept me out of reality. \\n\\nI don\\u2019t know what it is about you, I can\\u2019t help but let my mind wonder into the great possibilities that float throughout my imagination. I still look at your Facebook to see your face. I look at you mom\\u2019s to look at even more recent photos of you and sometimes picture myself next to you, too. \\n\\nWould you ever take me back? If the odds ever worked in our favor and we found ourselves alone for a night, would you take the time to rekindle the light we had or to reminisce about the ravenous sex we had? \\n\\nI hate to say it, but I would take any one night with you if I was given the opportunity.

Maybe I was still a bit tipsy off wine, or maybe it was intoxicating enough to be around you. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was something so different about you and I loved it. You made me feel butterflies I didn\\u2019t normally feel\\u2014 you were supposed to be another man I had a fun night with, not a lover I lost. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That\\u2019s what it feels like sometimes, like I lost you. Our world turned upside down and there was nothing anybody could do about it. One moment we were walking down the frozen dark streets of the city- laughing, chatting, kissing- and then the next week the city streets were bare, and we hadn\\u2019t spoken a word to one another since our petty argument. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I like to think about a time where the world stayed right side up, at least long enough for us to have made something out of whatever it was we were becoming. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Do you think we would\\u2019ve worked out? Part of me yearns to hear a yes from your lips, the same ones that took my breath away when you kissed me. One time, we were laying in your bed together. I was squished in between you and the wall, happily looking up at you. We started talking about bad kissers\\u2026 &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\\u201cSome people are just bad at kissing!\\u201d&lt;/em&gt; You exclaimed, smiling. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I agreed, but had to push your buttons- &lt;em&gt;\\u201cI think some people just kiss differently, I don\\u2019t think you can intentionally be good or bad.\\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I smiled then, because I was going to get what I wanted. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You kissed me. Sloppily, closely, simply. &lt;em&gt;\\u201cNow was that good?\\u201d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I opened my mouth to reply, but before I could you leaned in and kissed me again. I didn\\u2019t quite realize how good you really were at kissing until that moment you kissed me with so much passion and intention that you left me breathless. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wish I could get one more kiss like that from you, sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I feel guilty writing all of this, telling you how much I miss and yearn for you. I have someone I love dearly, more than I think I loved you in those moments you swept me out of reality. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I don\\u2019t know what it is about you, I can\\u2019t help but let my mind wonder into the great possibilities that float throughout my imagination. I still look at your Facebook to see your face. I look at you mom\\u2019s to look at even more recent photos of you and sometimes picture myself next to you, too. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Would you ever take me back? If the odds ever worked in our favor and we found ourselves alone for a night, would you take the time to rekindle the light we had or to reminisce about the ravenous sex we had? &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I hate to say it, but I would take any one night with you if I was given the opportunity. My curiosity makes me want to find out just what it is you think about me, if you feel anything towards me at all anymore. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I imagine us meeting again in the same streets we found each other on.

\\nand thank God i had you \\nto offer me a bed to stay in\\nbecause my pockets were empty and my feet were blistered \\nand i was sick\\nand i was starving \\nbut i had a warm bed to stay in\\nand that\\u2019s all i needed \\nwe landed and from the airport we navigated to the trains\\nand from the trains we navigated to kings cross  station \\nand from kings cross i navigated to a in front of the hostel their was a crowd of youths, of boys, \\ni became lost in it \\nand in this crowd i caught a pair of brown eyes staring at me\\nand then these brown eyes embraced me\\nand i found myself in the arms \\nof a person \\nwho i\\u2019ve never even met \\non this side of the bartop\\nand i found myself for the first time\\nin weeks of weariness \\nin the arms of someone slightly more than a stranger\\nand knowing that this stranger cared about my fate \\nchanged everything \\nwe talked for a moment, and then you slipped me a note \\nso neatly written, with directions to your flat. with what busses or trains to ride i took it and thanked you\\nyou told me you had to rush back to\\nwork\\nand so we went our way and you went back to yours \\nby the time i got through the tube ride to stebney green and finally\\nto your flat\\ni dropped everything, i showered, i collapsed \\nthanking you every moment\\nfor the warm bed beneath me\\nthe next morning i awoke sicker than a dog and exhausted.\\nyou came over.\\nnick made friends with your flat mate and we went on our walk \\nto mile end park \\ni don\\u2019t think london has ever had a day as warm and beautiful and the one we spent in mile end park. we enjoyed watching ducks tussle in the water and we sat in the grass\\ni watched you throw a ball&lt;br/&gt;\\nto a dog you had just met\\nin this i saw your affection for strangers person or animal\\ni tried my best to put into words what i had experienced the past two weeks, but the sickness and exhaustion made it difficult. \\nand i found myself captivated by the elegance of your language and words \\ni had never met someone who so conveyed beauty and intelligence like you\\nso this is what European girls are like i thought to myself \\ngrateful for your friendship but still i couldn\\u2019t help but think \\nthought for just a minute how it would feel to kiss you \\nbut i was sick and you had a busy busy life\\ni couldn\\u2019t ruin all of that for you by spreading my continental  flu\\nand even if i wasn\\u2019t sick i didn\\u2019t want to lose your friendship over a kiss\\nso i pushed it aside\\nwe walked home and before getting all the way there we stopped at a grocery store\\nand you bought us groceries\\nand i know damn well you were just as limited on money as any university student is\\ni couldn\\u2019t believe your generousity. \\nwe came inside and just as i began to cook.\\nyou let me know you had to depart\\nback to the place where i first met you\\nwe embraced a last time and i thanked you for the past 24 hours \\nand we made our promises to meet again \\nblissfully ignorant of how much life would change for us in between\\ni watched you leave \\nand i cursed myself for being so foggy minded and tired and not having enough time\\nand  i thanked the universe for the miracle of canceled flights and befriending bartenders in hostel barrooms.  and being stuck in london another 2 nights \\nand i made a promise i would come back. \\nno matter what it cost me\\nbecause 24 hours wasn\\u2019t enough time\\nto say thank you \\nfor what you\\u2019ve done for me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n

Why now? What could I possibly have to say? The irony is I\\u2019ve tried writing this particular letter many times over the year. Until now, I have failed on every occasion for reasons I soon hope to make clear to you. In the end, I thought a call was the only way I could explain anything at all. This was the wrong thing to do, and is the first of many apologies. I will respect your wishes, and try my best to put it into writing instead. I expect nothing in return \\u2013not even a reply- only that you read it. We never lied to each other Lilly, and I am going to say what has needed to be said for the longest time. I am accountable for so much, and have no one else to blame. This is about detailing what has been the coldest year of my life, and trying to explain everything that has led me to reach out to you. It\\u2019s difficult to even know where to start, and what does follow will be hard to read. But here we go.   \\n \\n\\nFirstly, I want to say I am so sorry for *everything*.   \\n \\n\\nI\\u2019m sorry for how things turned out, I\\u2019m sorry for how much I must have had hurt you, I\\u2019m sorry for not saying you hadn\\u2019t done anything wrong, I\\u2019m sorry I didn\\u2019t have the courage to talk to you in person, I\\u2019m sorry I didn\\u2019t give you so much as a hint as to an explanation why I left, I am sorry I couldn\\u2019t voice what was going on in my messed up head. I am so sorry I didn\\u2019t ask for the help I so terribly needed. At the time, I couldn\\u2019t begin to describe the hopelessness I was feeling. I simply did not know what I do know now, all at the beginning of the end of *us*.   \\n \\n\\nIn a way it\\u2019s easier to start from the present and work backwards, because everything is connected in this story. As does the way it all leads back to you, Lily. Earlier this year, I was finally diagnosed with severe depression. Not just the everyday type of sadness, no. It is the biological, uncontrollable, *crippling* kind of depression akin to bi-polar. Much like the way it found my Dad and my brother, it has found me too. It was present long before its diagnosis; like when I was growing up, during school, even the time we were a couple. Although when we were together, I was so happy Lilly. It was familiar, and I was safe in the knowledge that you were a constant. You were my rock. You were my best friend. You were someone I could trust in revealing the most emotional and vulnerable parts of myself. You were all I ever needed. I loved you. A big part of me still does. And it will continue to do so. And still, I took you for granted.   \\n \\n\\nI want to reassure that you were never the cause of me feeling so lost, Lily. In fact, as cruelly as hindsight allows, I now realise you were the only light I had during times I felt there was no escape from the darkness. After the bubble that was university, that darkness became far less controllable. As soon as we ended, it suddenly covered the world. In a weird way the diagnosis came as a relief. The doctor had finally given a name to what I had been so desperately at war with all this time.  \\n \\n\\nWhen I think back over the nearly 4 years we were together, I remember the times when the black fog settled in and the ways it then manifested in my behaviour. While I am entirely accountable for my actions, I often acted out for reasons I am not entirely sure off until now. You might remember the constant tiredness, my reluctance to travel (or often even to leave the house at all) and the obsessive behaviour (like wanting to get super strong all the time, to feel like I could protect people). It\\u2019s the latter that\\u2019s important, as it\\u2019s the reason why something so special came to an end.  This obsessive behaviour went hand in hand with anxiety, and the worry that I was never doing the right thing at the right time. This was responsible for the delusions of grandeur I held about the future. You know the ones; joining the army and being a hero, teaching English half way across the world etc. All that rubbish. For the most part, I refused to acknowledge I was ill. The thought crossed my mind on many occasions, but after seeing what my Dad went through just to get settled, you could forgive me in wanting to avoid coming to that conclusion. Let alone to share this worry with someone I was close to. What if you thought I was crazy? Would your wonderful family want me to be with you? Would my family feel guilty? Would I have to start taking pills just to feel normal again? So I ignored it.  \\n \\n\\nAt the time, I did feel we had problems in our relationship. The physical distance between us, even a couple of hours away by train, felt so much larger in practice. From working in the hell that was the call centre, to looking for a new job after that, setting time and money aside to see you regularly was becoming a source of stress. When I saw you, of course, these feelings were quickly forgotten, but I was always dreading the ride home as I knew the happy momentum we had built over the many trips would be broken yet again for weeks at a time. But looking back, these \\u2018problems\\u2019\\u2026 they were so *manageable* that they weren\\u2019t really problems at all. If I had only looked past the anxiety that was blowing them out of proportion\\u2026things might have been different. I take full responsibility, of course. I should have made the effort to see you more, I should have had the foresight that if I had waited just a while longer, that at 24, being that much more mature, I would be have been ready to move in with you. The phrase \\u201ctoo little, too late\\u201d springs to mind.   \\n \\n\\nAnd this brings us to the weekend of the convention I went to with Rory, and the biggest regret of my life in thinking the only option was to break us apart. Though I didn\\u2019t realise it, at the time I was probably at the peak of one of my depressive episodes. Come to think of it, April has always been a terrible time. It started all started with Phillip\\u2019s death in third year\\u2026Even so, I still made the choice to go without you, and ended up socialising with other girls. Nothing happened, Lilly. I didn\\u2019t betray your trust \\u2013 I never did. That was never part of me. But I wrongly thought there was more to life, other than that which I already had. I thought there was more yet to experience, away from us. Simply put, I felt guilty pretending I was single in front of people I didn\\u2019t know during that weekend. When I got home, I concluded I didn\\u2019t deserve you (I still don\\u2019t) and thought you could ultimately be so much happier without me (I still do). The rest we already know. I made a snap decision without even confiding in you, and I broke us up with a cruel whimper of an excuse over the phone like the coward I was.  \\n \\n\\nThe next part of this letter is secondary to me saying sorry for what I\\u2019ve done to you. Nothing will ever be as important, but I hope you continue reading.   \\n \\n\\nThe following couple of months were spent lamenting the fact I had lost a tender part of me. Distance aside, our phone call everyday was part of a beloved routine. Suddenly I was alone. All the clich\\u00e9 post break-up reassurances were thrown my way: \\u201cGive it a few weeks, and you\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d \\u201cGo out and find yourself someone else \\u2013 you\\u2019ll forget her soon enough.\\u201d They were wrong. I didn\\u2019t get out of bed, my motivation was shot, and I started drinking (I\\u2019m sober now) to feel anything other than a relentless numbness of spirit. I kept thinking what you were doing. It was almost like a state of dramatic shock, like us being torn apart was a poorly written plot in a panto. Some days, I half expected another visit from you. Other days, I boarded a train to Wales with the intent of seeing you any way I could. I nearly always ended up getting off at the first stop, in tears. April bled into summer, and I spent it freelancing as a cameraman for a performer that travelled the country. It took my mind off things, it was all the money I could earn and give to my parents, but I was wearing a mask to the world. Then Bart died.  \\n \\n\\nThis is significant as it was the day I pretty much gave up on people. And I lost interest in what life had to offer. We both knew he was an old cat, and we knew it would happen one day. But it was the *way* he died, Lilly.  He was stoned and beaten to death by a group of kids near my parents\\u2019 house. I had him on my lap purring away only that  very morning. He was probably waiting to greet the children on their way back  from school, like he usually did. I found him dying, a mess, and ran to the  vet just to have him put to sleep. I was the last thing he saw. I didn\\u2019t know  what fully happened that day until sometime after. But the sense of loss was  devastating. How could anyone be so cruel? He was my best friend, and I loved him  with all my heart. I had now lost you and Bart. It felt like some twisted karma.  This sent me into a downward spiral. I was at rock-bottom. The email I sent you to tell you what happened was a bitter sweet moment. You  didn\\u2019t have to give me the photo\\u2019s you had taken of your time with Bart, but you  did. It confirmed what I already knew in that you were the *kindest* woman I had ever met. You were someone that saw the good in everyone, someone who truly cared about others. You saw the good in me, even when I didn\\u2019t.   \\n \\n\\nFrom then on, I kept seeing your face every time I closed my eyes. I saw your smile, and heard your laugh. I dreamt of the times we cooked dinners, constructed gingerbread houses and sat silently atop a windy hill in each other\\u2019s arms. I relived the parties we dressed up as silly characters, smelling the flowers in the gardens we walked in, hearing the explosions of fireworks at New Years and the music of seedy clubs as we danced the night away. I savoured the taste of M&amp;S cookies and the soft skin of your rosy cheeks. Lilly, I saw again the day we graduated and felt the pride when being introduced as yours to your friends. I missed you so, so much. I still miss you *so*, *so much*. I could have called, but I didn\\u2019t. I could have sent you a message, but I didn\\u2019t. I did nothing other than think of a future that would no longer be. I had passed up on a life of happiness and a life of love; a life with Arthur and Evelyn, and a house by the sea.   \\n \\n\\nDuring this time, I kept sinking further down. Part of the problem lay with my parents, of whom you know I have always honest with. It was obvious they loved and missed you too, Lilly - especially my Mum. She thought I had found my \\u2018One.\\u2019 She reminded me of the fact a lot, whenever it was brought up. Like your parents, they had met early on in life. They believed in that kind of love story. Seeing their disappointed faces daily, at what their son had done and was slowly becoming, further added to the hopelessness I was feeling. Thus, my own sense of worthlessness stopped me from ever attempting to make amends. Truthfully, Lilly, I have thought about you every single day without fail - a whole year. Often, you are my first thought of the day and the last before sleep. I can simply not forget, let it go, or move on, without knowing you are happy. Because that is all I ever wanted in the end, whether it was with me or otherwise. I just wanted you to have a life that someone as wonderful as you deserved to have.  \\n \\n\\nAnd that draws me to the final part of the letter, and arguably the  hardest part to write. It\\u2019s difficult because I\\u2019m finally putting into words the  cold reality of the situation. I gave up the greatest thing in my life; I  hurt the one person that loved me in this entire world. I now have to live with  that. I am so terribly sorry. I don\\u2019t deserve your forgiveness, or ask for it. I  only wish you to understand what brought me to this dark place, with hope  that I can one day see you again (and share a pannad). I know from asking around  that you are with someone new. I hear he is close to home, too. That\\u2019s great. I sincerely hope he gives you everything I never could, and that he makes  you happy. If he has any sense at all, he will marry you. As I should  have done. Send my love to your folks, your brother Paul and your grandma. They were so kind to me, I will never  forget them.  \\n \\n\\nBefore I go, I just want to say I will only ever feel a softly heart-breaking warmth for you Lily. The kind only the thought of my first love could bring. Thank you so much \\u2013 I owe so many wonderful years to you. The time we spent together was truly the happiest time of my life, and I know that now. After all this, it\\u2019s hard to believe in something like fate anymore.

I tried to call her after year apart - she never answered. The letter soon followed. I broke up with her - it will forever be my greatest regret. This letter was my attempt at apologising. It was an acknowledgment that I needed help, which I got in the end.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Things did get better. We have met for that panad a few times now, even years later.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re something like friends. And in this life, and with every horror it throws my way, that&amp;#39;s more than enough for me.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;* The Wonder Years intro music starts playing *&lt;br/&gt;\\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dear Lilly,  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can understand your hesitancy in picking up the phone. Why now? What could I possibly have to say? The irony is I\\u2019ve tried writing this particular letter many times over the year. Until now, I have failed on every occasion for reasons I soon hope to make clear to you. In the end, I thought a call was the only way I could explain anything at all. This was the wrong thing to do, and is the first of many apologies. I will respect your wishes, and try my best to put it into writing instead. I expect nothing in return \\u2013not even a reply- only that you read it. We never lied to each other Lilly, and I am going to say what has needed to be said for the longest time. I am accountable for so much, and have no one else to blame. This is about detailing what has been the coldest year of my life, and trying to explain everything that has led me to reach out to you. It\\u2019s difficult to even know where to start, and what does follow will be hard to read. But here we go.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I want to say I am so sorry for &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I\\u2019m sorry for how things turned out, I\\u2019m sorry for how much I must have had hurt you, I\\u2019m sorry for not saying you hadn\\u2019t done anything wrong, I\\u2019m sorry I didn\\u2019t have the courage to talk to you in person, I\\u2019m sorry I didn\\u2019t give you so much as a hint as to an explanation why I left, I am sorry I couldn\\u2019t voice what was going on in my messed up head. I am so sorry I didn\\u2019t ask for the help I so terribly needed. At the time, I couldn\\u2019t begin to describe the hopelessness I was feeling. I simply did not know what I do know now, all at the beginning of the end of &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In a way it\\u2019s easier to start from the present and work backwards, because everything is connected in this story. As does the way it all leads back to you, Lily. Earlier this year, I was finally diagnosed with severe depression. Not just the everyday type of sadness, no. It is the biological, uncontrollable, &lt;em&gt;crippling&lt;/em&gt; kind of depression akin to bi-polar. Much like the way it found my Dad and my brother, it has found me too. It was present long before its diagnosis; like when I was growing up, during school, even the time we were a couple. Although when we were together, I was so happy Lilly. It was familiar, and I was safe in the knowledge that you were a constant. You were my rock. You were my best friend. You were someone I could trust in revealing the most emotional and vulnerable parts of myself. You were all I ever needed. I loved you. A big part of me still does. And it will continue to do so. And still, I took you for granted.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I want to reassure that you were never the cause of me feeling so lost, Lily. In fact, as cruelly as hindsight allows, I now realise you were the only light I had during times I felt there was no escape from the darkness. After the bubble that was university, that darkness became far less controllable. As soon as we ended, it suddenly covered the world. In a weird way the diagnosis came as a relief. The doctor had finally given a name to what I had been so desperately at war with all this time.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When I think back over the nearly 4 years we were together, I remember the times when the black fog settled in and the ways it then manifested in my behaviour. While I am entirely accountable for my actions, I often acted out for reasons I am not entirely sure off until now. You might remember the constant tiredness, my reluctance to travel (or often even to leave the house at all) and the obsessive behaviour (like wanting to get super strong all the time, to feel like I could protect people). It\\u2019s the latter that\\u2019s important, as it\\u2019s the reason why something so special came to an end.  This obsessive behaviour went hand in hand with anxiety, and the worry that I was never doing the right thing at the right time. This was responsible for the delusions of grandeur I held about the future. You know the ones; joining the army and being a hero, teaching English half way across the world etc. All that rubbish. For the most part, I refused to acknowledge I was ill. The thought crossed my mind on many occasions, but after seeing what my Dad went through just to get settled, you could forgive me in wanting to avoid coming to that conclusion. Let alone to share this worry with someone I was close to. What if you thought I was crazy? Would your wonderful family want me to be with you? Would my family feel guilty? Would I have to start taking pills just to feel normal again? So I ignored it.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At the time, I did feel we had problems in our relationship. The physical distance between us, even a couple of hours away by train, felt so much larger in practice. From working in the hell that was the call centre, to looking for a new job after that, setting time and money aside to see you regularly was becoming a source of stress. When I saw you, of course, these feelings were quickly forgotten, but I was always dreading the ride home as I knew the happy momentum we had built over the many trips would be broken yet again for weeks at a time. But looking back, these \\u2018problems\\u2019\\u2026 they were so &lt;em&gt;manageable&lt;/em&gt; that they weren\\u2019t really problems at all. If I had only looked past the anxiety that was blowing them out of proportion\\u2026things might have been different. I take full responsibility, of course. I should have made the effort to see you more, I should have had the foresight that if I had waited just a while longer, that at 24, being that much more mature, I would be have been ready to move in with you. The phrase \\u201ctoo little, too late\\u201d springs to mind.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And this brings us to the weekend of the convention I went to with Rory, and the biggest regret of my life in thinking the only option was to break us apart. Though I didn\\u2019t realise it, at the time I was probably at the peak of one of my depressive episodes. Come to think of it, April has always been a terrible time. It started all started with Phillip\\u2019s death in third year\\u2026Even so, I still made the choice to go without you, and ended up socialising with other girls. Nothing happened, Lilly. I didn\\u2019t betray your trust \\u2013 I never did. That was never part of me. But I wrongly thought there was more to life, other than that which I already had. I thought there was more yet to experience, away from us. Simply put, I felt guilty pretending I was single in front of people I didn\\u2019t know during that weekend. When I got home, I concluded I didn\\u2019t deserve you (I still don\\u2019t) and thought you could ultimately be so much happier without me (I still do). The rest we already know. I made a snap decision without even confiding in you, and I broke us up with a cruel whimper of an excuse over the phone like the coward I was.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The next part of this letter is secondary to me saying sorry for what I\\u2019ve done to you. Nothing will ever be as important, but I hope you continue reading.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The following couple of months were spent lamenting the fact I had lost a tender part of me. Distance aside, our phone call everyday was part of a beloved routine. Suddenly I was alone. All the clich\\u00e9 post break-up reassurances were thrown my way: \\u201cGive it a few weeks, and you\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d \\u201cGo out and find yourself someone else \\u2013 you\\u2019ll forget her soon enough.\\u201d They were wrong. I didn\\u2019t get out of bed, my motivation was shot, and I started drinking (I\\u2019m sober now) to feel anything other than a relentless numbness of spirit. I kept thinking what you were doing. It was almost like a state of dramatic shock, like us being torn apart was a poorly written plot in a panto. Some days, I half expected another visit from you. Other days, I boarded a train to Wales with the intent of seeing you any way I could. I nearly always ended up getting off at the first stop, in tears. April bled into summer, and I spent it freelancing as a cameraman for a performer that travelled the country. It took my mind off things, it was all the money I could earn and give to my parents, but I was wearing a mask to the world. Then Bart died.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This is significant as it was the day I pretty much gave up on people. And I lost interest in what life had to offer. We both knew he was an old cat, and we knew it would happen one day. But it was the &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; he died, Lilly.  He was stoned and beaten to death by a group of kids near my parents\\u2019 house. I had him on my lap purring away only that  very morning. He was probably waiting to greet the children on their way back  from school, like he usually did. I found him dying, a mess, and ran to the  vet just to have him put to sleep. I was the last thing he saw. I didn\\u2019t know  what fully happened that day until sometime after. But the sense of loss was  devastating. How could anyone be so cruel? He was my best friend, and I loved him  with all my heart. I had now lost you and Bart. It felt like some twisted karma.  This sent me into a downward spiral. I was at rock-bottom. The email I sent you to tell you what happened was a bitter sweet moment. You  didn\\u2019t have to give me the photo\\u2019s you had taken of your time with Bart, but you  did. It confirmed what I already knew in that you were the &lt;em&gt;kindest&lt;/em&gt; woman I had ever met. You were someone that saw the good in everyone, someone who truly cared about others. You saw the good in me, even when I didn\\u2019t.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;From then on, I kept seeing your face every time I closed my eyes. I saw your smile, and heard your laugh. I dreamt of the times we cooked dinners, constructed gingerbread houses and sat silently atop a windy hill in each other\\u2019s arms. I relived the parties we dressed up as silly characters, smelling the flowers in the gardens we walked in, hearing the explosions of fireworks at New Years and the music of seedy clubs as we danced the night away. I savoured the taste of M&amp;amp;S cookies and the soft skin of your rosy cheeks. Lilly, I saw again the day we graduated and felt the pride when being introduced as yours to your friends. I missed you so, so much. I still miss you &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt;. I could have called, but I didn\\u2019t. I could have sent you a message, but I didn\\u2019t. I did nothing other than think of a future that would no longer be. I had passed up on a life of happiness and a life of love; a life with Arthur and Evelyn, and a house by the sea.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;During this time, I kept sinking further down. Part of the problem lay with my parents, of whom you know I have always honest with. It was obvious they loved and missed you too, Lilly - especially my Mum. She thought I had found my \\u2018One.\\u2019 She reminded me of the fact a lot, whenever it was brought up. Like your parents, they had met early on in life. They believed in that kind of love story. Seeing their disappointed faces daily, at what their son had done and was slowly becoming, further added to the hopelessness I was feeling. Thus, my own sense of worthlessness stopped me from ever attempting to make amends. Truthfully, Lilly, I have thought about you every single day without fail - a whole year. Often, you are my first thought of the day and the last before sleep. I can simply not forget, let it go, or move on, without knowing you are happy. Because that is all I ever wanted in the end, whether it was with me or otherwise. I just wanted you to have a life that someone as wonderful as you deserved to have.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And that draws me to the final part of the letter, and arguably the  hardest part to write. It\\u2019s difficult because I\\u2019m finally putting into words the  cold reality of the situation. I gave up the greatest thing in my life; I  hurt the one person that loved me in this entire world. I now have to live with  that. I am so terribly sorry. I don\\u2019t deserve your forgiveness, or ask for it. I  only wish you to understand what brought me to this dark place, with hope  that I can one day see you again (and share a pannad). I know from asking around  that you are with someone new. I hear he is close to home, too. That\\u2019s great. I sincerely hope he gives you everything I never could, and that he makes  you happy. If he has any sense at all, he will marry you. As I should  have done. Send my love to your folks, your brother Paul and your grandma. They were so kind to me, I will never  forget them.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before I go, I just want to say I will only ever feel a softly heart-breaking warmth for you Lily. The kind only the thought of my first love could bring. Thank you so much \\u2013 I owe so many wonderful years to you. The time we spent together was truly the happiest time of my life, and I know that now. After all this, it\\u2019s hard to believe in something like fate anymore. But who knows \\u2013 I really do hope I\\u2019m wrong.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I will love you, always.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Tom&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 0.84,\n            \"upVotes\": 4,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/tmp812/a_year_late_letter/\",\n            \"username\": \"ThoughtfulMothman\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_ssw65v\": {\n            \"title\": \"Safety.\",\n            \"body\": \"When you think of love, you think of grand gestures, loud confessions of love.\\n\\nI want the quiet love.\\n\\nThe love that\\u2019s always there.\\n\\nCalm.

I really don't do this enough and I probably should shout from the top of every possible roof and mountain about how incredible she is and how much I love her.\\n\\nIt's her eyes that made me first completely attracted to her. We met online so the first thing that got me hooked was just how incredibly beautiful she was. And it absolutely was her eyes. I get lost in them every single time I look at her and it's her gaze and the way she looks at me that makes me feel like I'm the only man in the entire world for her. I look like an utter dork in every picture but when we take shots together and she's looking up at me with stars in her eyes, it's the best feeling I've ever felt in my life.\\n\\nThe second most amazing quality is her unrelenting and continuing love for me. Look, I'm a guy and I absolutely screw up A LOT. But where so many other women would write me off, send me on my way and never have anything to do with me ever again, she never stops loving me.

I am sincerely and deeply sorry!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 0,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 0.92,\n            \"upVotes\": 10,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/rn4zml/letter_to_76/\",\n            \"username\": \"YewChewber\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        },\n        \"t3_rq4tc9\": {\n            \"title\": \"My Michelle...\",\n            \"body\": \"URL: https://www.reddit.com/gallery/rq4tc9\\n\",\n            \"createdAt\": \"2021-12-28T02:56:15.000Z\",\n            \"topics\": [],\n            \"html\": \"URL: https://www.reddit.com/gallery/rq4tc9\\n\",\n            \"numberOfComments\": 2,\n            \"upVoteRatio\": 1.0,\n            \"upVotes\": 19,\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/rq4tc9/my_michelle/\",\n            \"username\": \"MrDooM__\",\n            \"comments\": []\n        }\n    }\n}"
