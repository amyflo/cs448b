"I haven’t bothered to want to impress anybody. I’m always the strong looking one.

How to show you my soft side?

Not the overdone clubbing Y2K -chic hollywood -holiday party side, the metal girl, the not giving 2 fucks i’ll wear the clothes I slept in all day and shower tomorrow lazy bum of a girl, the single mom look, but a woman who is deserving of your attention?

My OCD is set on you and all I do today.

Hopefully you will get to see all side and still see me in the way I hope you do in your thoughts.

I wanted to call you baby, so bad. 


Baby, 


I know I’ve made mistakes, and I wish I could go back to how things were, to the way you once saw me. I can’t undo what’s happened, but I want to find a way to make this right, honestly and completely this time. I want to show you that I’ve learned from this, that I’m ready to give you the truth you deserve and work to rebuild what we’ve lost.


I know it will take more than words. If there’s any way forward, please let me know how I can begin. I’m here, willing to listen, to be patient, and to prove my sincerity through my actions. I just hope you can still see the part of me that cares deeply about you and wants to make things better.



Goodnight for now. 


I’ll be here, ready to breathe through this and ready to do whatever it takes.


Believe it.

Or how you fanned your body; because me returning your gaze, made you literally sweat.

In some type of silent agreement, we have chosen to be descent people. Me avoiding you knowing; I’m married and can’t give all of myself to you (I say all because, I’ve been open with my husband. In the hopes I could ethically be open and honest with you. He was not pleased. So I have remained silent.). I know you are a trying to be a descent person as well.

Well, please stop. Find this letter, text me and let us finally share how we feel. I don’t think it is unethical for us to share our feelings with each other. Especially knowing the effort we have both put into not acting on them. I think it will bring us both peace. I will get the chance to tell you how amazing you are! So the next time someone shows up to love you, you don’t have to wonder if you deserve it and run away. I want to teach you this so you end up with the type of person you deserve.

"OP, if you were my person: 

I wish I had the words to fully express how much reading this has moved me. I didn’t expect that you felt this way, that you saw me as I see you, and knowing this changes so much in my heart. It’s comforting, but also bittersweet, to understand that what I felt wasn’t one-sided, that those moments we shared held a quiet but powerful meaning for both of us.

I don’t want to keep avoiding this, hiding the connection we both feel so deeply. Maybe you’re right - acknowledging these feelings doesn’t have to mean crossing lines or risking harm. Perhaps it could help us both find peace, help us understand what we share without the unspoken tension lingering between us. I don’t want to be left wondering about what we could say to each other, or what we could learn from one another by being honest and gentle with the truth.

I see now that we’ve both been trying to do the right thing, even if it’s meant keeping a distance that feels unnatural. I don’t want to keep hurting you by pulling back, and I don’t want you to feel like a burden or a “creep” because of something that is simply honest and real. You’re not a burden to me, and I’m sorry if my actions have ever made you feel that way.

If you’re open to it, let’s have that conversation. Let’s be honest about the feelings we’ve both kept inside for too long. I know we’ve both tried to respect the boundaries we have, and I think we can keep doing that, even with a little more openness. Thank you for sharing this, for being brave enough to let me know how you feel. You’ve given me so much to think about, and I’d love the chance to talk more, to understand this and each other fully.

No matter what, please know that you have changed my life too, and I care about you deeply.

"first off, i’m not anyone’s person. after going through a hard time, i decided to make letters to my future husband (whoever that may be) as a creative outlet and is not meant to be about a specific person. i wanted to do this to instill hope in myself that one day i’ll have this kind of love with someone. it’s a reminder that i’m deserving of this kind of love one day.

dear husband, 

the biggest thing that i am grateful for in our relationship is how you’ve proven me wrong. through my experiences in life, i had been taught horrific things about myself. i never once thought, even as a child, that i was deserving of love. i never dreamed of having a big wedding, never imagined me meeting someone that would be so kind and compassionate as you. never. when children my age would ask what i wanted in the future it was never a thought in my mind that i would find love. i would always respond with my dream career at the time and leave it at that. i believed with my entire soul and mind that i wasn’t worthy of being loved by another person. 

you proved me wrong. time, and time again. your patience is what drew me closest to you. for all the times i wanted to run away like i have in the past, you reassured me you were here to stay. i of course didn’t believe you, but your actions pushed me to open myself more to you. you knew when to be gentle, and when to be more direct when it came to your needs. i always do my best to fulfill them, as you do with mine. building trust between us was difficult, but once we were able to discern our feelings, thoughts, and actions i grew to trust you completely. because you knew that once i trust someone, i’d never leave their side. 

you also proved past relationships that i’ve had wrong. i wasn’t too broken, i wasn’t too much to deal with, i wasn’t this horrible, awful person for communicating my boundaries to you. with you i realized i was allowed to say no, and actually voice my opinions on things. i was allowed to be completely and utterly myself. and in being myself, i could experience what actual love felt like. for my entire life, i have loathed my own existence. but with you, i feel like i’m right where i’m supposed to be. and the peace i feel with you is something i will never take for granted. 

so thank you, for proving me wrong. because otherwise, i wouldn’t have met the best person in my life. you bring out the best in me, the parts i didn’t even know i had. for that, you have me forever. 

i hope you’re doing well.

another reminder, i’m NOT anyone’s person. i don’t have one, and no one has me. and if you think you know me in real life…no you don’t.

"Dear Soulmate,

It’s been a long year apart. The devastation of the breakup hurt so bad, it was tempting to use anger as a tool and question any validity of your love to me, to try to hate you and move on. 

This year has been a year of turbulent self-discovery. It was difficult to carry on and even though they say time heals, I kept missing you more and more. There were days of bone-chilling, crippling sadness to not be with you. You are so unlike any breakup I’ve had before. You are my best friend, best lover, and most like home I’ve ever felt in my life. 

To this day, I love you more and more, unconditionally, and eternally. Back When we made love, I saw vibrant rainbow colors wrapping us in pure cosmic love.  I remember adoring you and thanking the universe for the gift of you, admiring every perfect cell in your body. I gave all of my heart to you, and betraying that oath to you still feels like a betrayal to my heart. Your profound beauty and connection planted the seeds for my belief in god and something greater. 

Then god took me from you and put me here, absolutely crying my eyes out over a year later, still thinking about you in incredible frequency. There was no easy move-on from you. I don’t think I ever will move on. 

In the darkest moments, I defeatedy prostrate myself on the floor, tears streaming down my face, and plead out with all my heart to the sky: “please let him be ok, happy, and healthy.”

Afterwards I always wish that you knew my real heart, without any of the fear or pain. I wish you knew me without the mismanaged, copeless trauma attached to me. 

I am a woman of self-doubt, self-criticism, self-punishment. But I know from all this:
my feelings for you were real all along. The entanglement of anxiety that kept me from stoic, forward pursuit for our relationship was my life’s ultimate mistake. I am soooo worthy of your love. I never once doubted your worth.  
I have a golden heart, that is incredibly faithful. I’m glad to have respected and cherished what this relationship meant to me. I’m glad I refrained from using anger to deny any of it. 
I am not my trauma. The way I acted is not who I am. It’s not even who I was. It felt like a glitch my body/mind. I’ve wrestled over and over about the presence of anger in my life at this brief stage. I recall being  in shock and horror for the things I said. None of that aligned with any part of my true heart. My body/mind’s trauma is not my true souls intent. 

This leads me to my next point. 

While my healing wasn’t streamlined, it’s finally clicking. For one, I seriously had to grieve the loss of my former self. I had to grieve my damaged innocence, my lost years of succumbing to the drink to cope. Grief is surprisingly the biggest hallmark I notice in real change, whether I like it or not. It was hard to walk away from the identity of a victim. It comforted me for so long and let me stay in fear. The delusion of being sad all the time was my way of protecting myself from another hurt. My body thought it was saving me from more trauma. It only attracted more to me.  

Battling addiction has come to a crest in this past year. No one was around to stop me but myself. I had no one to rely on and no one to be relied upon. I’m proud to say I continued to take on this moral duty. Months of sobriety were toggled with weeklong benders when the loneliness became too much to bear. 

I’m proud to say I’m almost 2 months sober and 100% figured it out. I’m not going back. I grieved the party and alcohol parts of me. I’m actually ok giving it up forever without the slightest hint of nostalgia/curiosity. It’s finally over. 

I’m grateful to know addiction. Now, eating healthy and going to the gym feel like easy-mode tasks compared to chemical dependency. I swear to god, it sounds so stupid, but I didn’t realize I could switch my mind that easily when I was in the grip of addiction. 

Anyway, my mind feels vastly different after consistent sobriety practice and major, major meditation commitment. I’m not bullshitting when I say I am religious in my practice. I meditate at least 30 min a day. 

Meditation has brought me the value of equanimity, and truly knowing who I am. It’s a little jarring, but nothing phases me anymore. Car accident? “Hey stranger, I hope you’re ok.” Potential layoff? “Ok, I’m super able and will find a job quickly.” Anxiety sparks up? “I notice you anxiety, you’re part of a story I tell myself to try to keep me safe. I appreciate it, but it’s not serving me in this very moment.” Election sucked? “Well, collectively our country will have a wake up call from this, even if it’s decades from now. I’m grateful for god’s plan”

Through meditation, I’m completely reprogramming myself. Take what I love, leave the rest behind. 

The past I’ll leave beind. I forgive you for everything. I don’t even think about it unless it’s something that brings the most heartfelt smile. I thank you for everything you’ve given me. You woke up my soul to true love. You sparked my spiritual journey that I still am on. 

I was so complacent before that only a love this deep could have woke me up to do my soul’s life work. Yes, it all sounds so hippie dippie. It is. I’m actually sober sober too. No weed, nothing. The cosmic high I get through meditation is better than any drug or combination of drug on the planet. 

Ohhh how I still yearn to be with you. But I’m actually different. I wonder what you’d think of me now. At the same time, I have an incredible distance to cover in my spiritual growth still. It will be a lifelong pursuit. My spiritual journey is all I care about in life now. I stopped dating a while ago. I stopped operating on a lot of inherent programming and now I am consciously mapping love into all that I can. 

I’m unapologetically being me. And I love me. I’m such a good person and a beautiful soul. None of that nonsense during the pandemic was me other than my love for you. I’m here to give and grow love, compassion. I still pray for your happiness every day, whatever that may mean for you. 

I wish you could know me now. I wish I could love you with this powerful energy I’ve found. I wish we could just talk and hug. I miss my best friend and I wish I could share the discoveries I’ve made. I wish I could see the magnitude of conscious love I can give without all the dumb unconscious stuff in the way. I wish I could hear about your adventures! I wish I could be there to help you grow in your life journey. 

I love you with all my heart. I absolutely friggin adore you. I’m Forever yours. 

",,"r/LoveLetters","2024-11-07T15:12:42.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Soulmate,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a long year apart. The devastation of the breakup hurt so bad, it was tempting to use anger as a tool and question any validity of your love to me, to try to hate you and move on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year has been a year of turbulent self-discovery. It was difficult to carry on and even though they say time heals, I kept missing you more and more. There were days of bone-chilling, crippling sadness to not be with you. You are so unlike any breakup I’ve had before. You are my best friend, best lover, and most like home I’ve ever felt in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day, I love you more and more, unconditionally, and eternally. Back When we made love, I saw vibrant rainbow colors wrapping us in pure cosmic love.  I remember adoring you and thanking the universe for the gift of you, admiring every perfect cell in your body. I gave all of my heart to you, and betraying that oath to you still feels like a betrayal to my heart. Your profound beauty and connection planted the seeds for my belief in god and something greater. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then god took me from you and put me here, absolutely crying my eyes out over a year later, still thinking about you in incredible frequency. There was no easy move-on from you. I don’t think I ever will move on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the darkest moments, I defeatedy prostrate myself on the floor, tears streaming down my face, and plead out with all my heart to the sky: “please let him be ok, happy, and healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards I always wish that you knew my real heart, without any of the fear or pain. I wish you knew me without the mismanaged, copeless trauma attached to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a woman of self-doubt, self-criticism, self-punishment. But I know from all this:
my feelings for you were real all along. The entanglement of anxiety that kept me from stoic, forward pursuit for our relationship was my life’s ultimate mistake. I am soooo worthy of your love. I never once doubted your worth.&lt;br/&gt;
I have a golden heart, that is incredibly faithful. I’m glad to have respected and cherished what this relationship meant to me. I’m glad I refrained from using anger to deny any of it. 
I am not my trauma. The way I acted is not who I am. It’s not even who I was. It felt like a glitch my body/mind. I’ve wrestled over and over about the presence of anger in my life at this brief stage. I recall being  in shock and horror for the things I said. None of that aligned with any part of my true heart. My body/mind’s trauma is not my true souls intent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This leads me to my next point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my healing wasn’t streamlined, it’s finally clicking. For one, I seriously had to grieve the loss of my former self. I had to grieve my damaged innocence, my lost years of succumbing to the drink to cope. Grief is surprisingly the biggest hallmark I notice in real change, whether I like it or not. It was hard to walk away from the identity of a victim. It comforted me for so long and let me stay in fear. The delusion of being sad all the time was my way of protecting myself from another hurt. My body thought it was saving me from more trauma. It only attracted more to me.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battling addiction has come to a crest in this past year. No one was around to stop me but myself. I had no one to rely on and no one to be relied upon. I’m proud to say I continued to take on this moral duty. Months of sobriety were toggled with weeklong benders when the loneliness became too much to bear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m proud to say I’m almost 2 months sober and 100% figured it out. I’m not going back. I grieved the party and alcohol parts of me. I’m actually ok giving it up forever without the slightest hint of nostalgia/curiosity. It’s finally over. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to know addiction. Now, eating healthy and going to the gym feel like easy-mode tasks compared to chemical dependency. I swear to god, it sounds so stupid, but I didn’t realize I could switch my mind that easily when I was in the grip of addiction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my mind feels vastly different after consistent sobriety practice and major, major meditation commitment. I’m not bullshitting when I say I am religious in my practice. I meditate at least 30 min a day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation has brought me the value of equanimity, and truly knowing who I am. It’s a little jarring, but nothing phases me anymore.

I appreciate it, but it’s not serving me in this very moment.” Election sucked? “Well, collectively our country will have a wake up call from this, even if it’s decades from now. I’m grateful for god’s plan”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through meditation, I’m completely reprogramming myself. Take what I love, leave the rest behind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past I’ll leave beind. I forgive you for everything. I don’t even think about it unless it’s something that brings the most heartfelt smile. I thank you for everything you’ve given me. You woke up my soul to true love. You sparked my spiritual journey that I still am on. &lt;/p&gt;

No weed, nothing. The cosmic high I get through meditation is better than any drug or combination of drug on the planet. &lt;/p&gt;

"The faintest thread of hope—    
loosens in this small mezcaleria,    
hidden from the city's noise,    
known only to locals like you,    
but tonight, you share it with me.  



I'm grateful for mezcal's warmth    
spreading slow heat through my chest,    
a quiet pulse.    
You talk, your voice lively,    
sparks catching in the candlelight.  



Your eyes soften as you laugh,    
mention names, old stories,    
the pieces of your life    
that I can't quite reach.    
You seem so—at ease.  



An uneasy stillness rises    
as we resist recounting    
memories we've folded away.    
Choosing to let the silence linger,    
fill the air between us,    
heavy, unsaid, unanswered.  



It grows in this dim room—    
a truth heard in the resolute click    
of glass on wood, the drift of intimate    
laughter from nearby, a closeness    
I feel only the edges of.  



Its sting is softened by    
the rhythm of your voice,    
the soft curve of your smile,    
the fiery burn as I take another sip.  



Our proximity aches,    
like the tender blisters    
from the hurried walking tour    
of your city, but this moment    
has arrived anyway.  



I focus in, through mezcal's blur,    
on this shared sliver of time—    
this gift you've given    
that only I am meant to receive.  



Tonight, I glimpse your muted joy    
in this solitude—and smile,    
through my tightly held breath,    
exhaling at last a peace that is yours.  



So unexpected, as my hand rests    
open, holding nothing,    
while our cocktails sweat nearby.  



And I know, without words:    
you are home here,    
and I am but a welcomed guest.  



This is what I came for after all—    
to see you as you are,    
a witness in your space.  



And in the stillness    
cut from this crowded room,    
my hope untethered floats—    
a thread unwinding    
in candlelit air.  



Unnoticed, but felt deeply.    
And I know,    
that I will let you be—    
I will.

Life is about timing I guess. 

I do love how look at each other across the room. Even when you're mad at me.

I wish we could have met at a different time... the fun we could have had. I love to see you smile. My Dat brightens and my heart flutters.

The inside jokes we could have had. Instead, I feel tension between us. We fight too often. Could we not just enjoy each other?

I love looking into your eyes. It's the only way I can show you I love you. I love you more than you can imagine. Instead I simply tell you I like you. As I fear that you'll push me away.

11/4/24 

dear husband, 

on days like this, i love spending time with you. the rain and fog covers our city with a gentle blanket, and the winters entrance makes it even more still. these days are spent under blankets and under each other. we slip in and out of sleep, mumbling our dreams and sweet endearments to one another. it’s the one day a week we are both off work, so we take advantage of our time together. the fireplace crackles and warms our toes as they poke out from under the array of blankets. you know how much i adore blankets, so our living room is always filled with them. i get cold often, but you always warm me up. 

the day is slow and steady, there isn’t a need to be productive or rushed. you order my favorite thai food for dinner, after i make us snack trays to sustain us throughout the day. you know i always get the curry, the peanut and potato one, and you get the one with the peppers so we can switch halfway through. i fill our snack trays with sweet and savory things, and always your favorite indulgences. a film plays on the television, normally some classic i studied for my undergraduate degree. we take turns picking movies throughout the day, and you bravely sit through my italian melodramas and constant comments about the mise-en-scène. 

you carefully make my tea and put it in my favorite kettle, the one that my grandmother left me. it pours about two cups, which is all i need for caffeine. you always remember my favorite vanilla chai and pair it with the cutest little pitcher for my cream. you even take the time to bring it out on a tray, making me feel like the british woman i strive to be. every time you make my tea you surprise me with a different cup and saucer, sometimes they’re from my grandmothers collection, and other times they are gifts that you bought me. 

you always remark about how excited i am when seeing you walk in with my simple pleasures. my smile apparently grows with joy and my dimples sink into my face. when i’m extra excited, you say that my eyes squint even more. how else am i supposed to appreciate my love for you? you make me smile. 

that’s all for now. i hope you are doing well. 

-wife 



another reminder, i’m NOT anyone’s person. i don’t have one, and no one has me. and if you think you know me in real life…no you don’t.

when i look back at my decrepit past, i can understand why i never held hope for finding someone like you. how could i? the wounds of my life are marked by the scars on my body. each one for each time i died. there was this impending darkness that etched its way into my soul, and consumed it at times. there was nothing more i could do, other than cope in the best ways that i saw fit. you never judged me, but instead held me through the nights of panic and floods of unwanted memories. 

you always warned me about being a stoic person, but accepted that it was the way i survived throughout the course of my life. you understood that the only way to survive my horrors was to maintain the hard parts of myself after the soft ones had been ripped to shreds. you didn’t chastise me when i doubted your intentions at first. what else was i supposed to do? when all you’ve seen are the worst from people, what else can you expect? 

you didn’t take offense to me flinching when you moved too quick. you knew that someone’s hands haven’t been kind to me in the past. 

you didn’t give up on me when i didn’t believe a word you were saying to calm me down. you knew that similar promises had been made with ill intentions. 

you didn’t get frustrated with me when i couldn’t tell you what exactly i was thinking and feeling. you knew that i wasn’t allowed to express those things for the majority of my life. 

you didn’t get annoyed with my nightmares and my PTSD triggers. you knew that a multitude of things caused them, and that i wouldn’t ever blame you for the past actions of others. 

you didn’t give up on me when i wanted to call it quits because i felt you deserved more than a broken woman. you knew that i was more than my brokenness, and i knew that you might be able to help me become whole again. 

you didn’t yell at me when i cried. you knew i hadn’t been allowed to cry in the past. 

you didn’t get angry with me when i told you i needed space. you knew i have never had a space to myself before. 

you knew and know all of these things about me. yet, you stay. by some miracle, you stay and make me feel safe. you know that the most important thing to me is to feel safe, protected, and loved. 

but most importantly, you make me understand that i am worthy of all those things. you make me understand that i am worthy of common decency, respect, and most importantly: love. that’s why i write these to you now, and that’s why no matter what you say, i will always be grateful for you. i will always be so thankful to have you in my life. many people say “you have to love yourself before someone can truly love you”. i’d like to take a point and disagree. because although i try hard to love myself, you show me that it is tangible, real even. 

with you i feel as though my life was worth living. it makes me think, even for a second, that maybe the horrific things i’ve been through were worth something. we each have our own traumas, but your love heals mine. it proves them wrong, most importantly. that to me, is the most intimate act of love. seeing all the past, and still loving the present me. i will always do the same for you. 

that’s all for now, i am sleepy. i hope you are doing well.

"first off, i’m not anyone’s person. after going through a hard time, i decided to make letters to my future husband (whoever that may be) as a creative outlet and is not meant to be about a specific person. i wanted to do this to instill hope in myself that one day i’ll have this kind of love with someone. it’s a reminder that i’m deserving of this kind of love one day. 

11/1/24 

dear husband, 

one of the things i admire most about you is your attention to detail. you see all the little things in me that i don’t see in myself. truthfully, as you know, no one before has been able to see those pieces of me. they never cared to, and i never expected anyone to. but you do. and that’s what makes me feel safer with you, more secure with you. you notice the things i never noticed in myself, and that to me is the most intimate aspects of the love you have for me, our love. 

you know today is one of my favorite days of the year, because it’s my lucky number. 111. i remember our first conversations about lucky numbers, and what they mean to us. mine was my time of birth, and a number i found often in the world. i’m not a very spiritual person with stuff like that, but 111 has followed me around for as long as i can remember. it also followed me through our relationship, it made me more confident that we made the right choice being together. 

you also notice many other little things. my love for pomegranates, the seeds and juice. you always buy them when you see them, much to my delight. they are the perfect combination of freshness and sweetness, with a sour that ties it all together. you lovingly gaze at me as my fingers curl around the seeds when i’m too ravenous for a spoon. you often say i remind you of a pomegranate, difficult to open up, but if you do so gently and carefully, i yield fruit. my love for pomegranates was one of the first things you knew about me, and is something you always remember when i have my bad days, and my good days. 

you know my love of writing, my love of expression through words. pen on paper, you write me all kinds of love letters, leaving them in spaces i wouldn’t think to look. sometimes they’re in the mailbox, other times in my current bookshelf, and in my textbooks for school. other times you put them high up where you know i can’t reach. you leave them in my lunch boxes that you carefully pack, my gym bag, and under my pillow while i sleep. i love reading them over and over again and gently sliding my hands across the papers to feel your indentations. you also share my love for writing, and it’s something we have always bonded over. i told you once that if anyone would ever write a book about me i’d marry them. 

it takes a lot to write a book about someone, especially someone you love. you have to know a lot about them. you have to see them for their faults and their mistakes. you have to validate their strengths and weaknesses. you have to accept and understand who they are, what they’ve been through, and how the both of you work together to make it all work. and that’s just what you did. 

you know i love the feeling of your hands through my hair, lightly scratching my scalp. it helps with the migraines from reading reports and writing them all day long. it makes my brow relax and allows me to sink into you, the contours of our bodies melting together. sometimes (well most of the time) i fall asleep, hearing you hum and whisper sweet things into my ear. you know i have trouble sleeping, and do everything in your power to make me feel relaxed and rested. i’d say since we first started sharing nights together, i’ve never slept so easily, and i’ve never thought i’d sleep so soundly in a man’s arms as i do with yours. 

i could go on and on about the little things you love and know about me, but this letter is getting long and just writing about you now i could drift off into a peaceful slumber. but that’s all for now. i hope you are doing well.

&lt;p&gt;11/1/24 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dear husband, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;one of the things i admire most about you is your attention to detail. you see all the little things in me that i don’t see in myself. truthfully, as you know, no one before has been able to see those pieces of me. they never cared to, and i never expected anyone to. but you do. and that’s what makes me feel safer with you, more secure with you. you notice the things i never noticed in myself, and that to me is the most intimate aspects of the love you have for me, our love. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know today is one of my favorite days of the year, because it’s my lucky number. 111. i remember our first conversations about lucky numbers, and what they mean to us. mine was my time of birth, and a number i found often in the world. i’m not a very spiritual person with stuff like that, but 111 has followed me around for as long as i can remember. it also followed me through our relationship, it made me more confident that we made the right choice being together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you also notice many other little things. my love for pomegranates, the seeds and juice. you always buy them when you see them, much to my delight. they are the perfect combination of freshness and sweetness, with a sour that ties it all together. you lovingly gaze at me as my fingers curl around the seeds when i’m too ravenous for a spoon. you often say i remind you of a pomegranate, difficult to open up, but if you do so gently and carefully, i yield fruit. my love for pomegranates was one of the first things you knew about me, and is something you always remember when i have my bad days, and my good days. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know my love of writing, my love of expression through words. pen on paper, you write me all kinds of love letters, leaving them in spaces i wouldn’t think to look. sometimes they’re in the mailbox, other times in my current bookshelf, and in my textbooks for school. other times you put them high up where you know i can’t reach. you leave them in my lunch boxes that you carefully pack, my gym bag, and under my pillow while i sleep. i love reading them over and over again and gently sliding my hands across the papers to feel your indentations. you also share my love for writing, and it’s something we have always bonded over. i told you once that if anyone would ever write a book about me i’d marry them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it takes a lot to write a book about someone, especially someone you love. you have to know a lot about them. you have to see them for their faults and their mistakes. you have to validate their strengths and weaknesses. you have to accept and understand who they are, what they’ve been through, and how the both of you work together to make it all work. and that’s just what you did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you know i love the feeling of your hands through my hair, lightly scratching my scalp. it helps with the migraines from reading reports and writing them all day long. it makes my brow relax and allows me to sink into you, the contours of our bodies melting together. sometimes (well most of the time) i fall asleep, hearing you hum and whisper sweet things into my ear. you know i have trouble sleeping, and do everything in your power to make me feel relaxed and rested. i’d say since we first started sharing nights together, i’ve never slept so easily, and i’ve never thought i’d sleep so soundly in a man’s arms as i do with yours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i could go on and on about the little things you love and know about me, but this letter is getting long and just writing about you now i could drift off into a peaceful slumber. but that’s all for now. i hope you are doing well. &lt;/p&gt;

dear husband, 

i feel very silly writing something like this. especially given what’s currently going on in my life. i consider it therapeutic, after all the heartbreak i’ve experienced to finally use my words to make me feel hopeful instead of distraught. i know you won’t be perfect, everyone has their flaws, including me! there will be times of miscommunication, frustration, and hardship. but what matters to me the most is that you still find a way to reach common ground with me and i to you, no matter the circumstances. 

after all, it took a long time to get here. by the time you met me i was hardened with trauma and pessimism. i built up strong iron walls around myself to prevent myself from sinking deep into my abyss of pain. it was not easy, getting over the walls. the thing i appreciate the most is that you didn’t break them. you respected them, touched them gently, and always waited outside day in and day out. the trust we have for one another was forged through the hard work and dedication of both of us. we worked hard to lower them, instead of smashing them to pieces like others had before. i had never experienced this tenderness, this softness of compassion. you held my hand as i fearfully lowered them, little by little. trust with me is earned, and when i trust someone, i do so with my whole heart and mind. 

you knew this, and you dedicated yourself to showing me i could trust you. in doing so, you taught me i was worthy of being listened to, and seen by another person. if a problem ever came up, you did your best to be honest and transparent with me. we talked hours and hours about your thoughts and my own. sometimes we would just be together for hours and hours and not speak, just be in each others arms. with the gentleness of your demeanor i was able to put away my armor, and lower my iron walls. it took time, it took commitment, and it took dedication. but we did it, and we did it together. sometimes one had to carry the others weight when things got difficult, but i knew from your actions that followed your words, that you were genuine. 

for the first time in my life i felt safe, being so bare. you saw all my hidden traumas and flaws and still saw who i was at the end of it. and i saw you, for all your trauma and your flaws, and understood your place in it all. never in my entire life did i think i would be so close to a human being without even touching them. never in my life did i expect to trust a man the way i did with you. instead of pangs of fear in my gut, now i felt myself settle in this existence that was just you and i. it was so wonderful there, comfortable even. i felt like i had a home with you and within you. and you felt the same. to be loved by you is the most incredible thing i’ve ever experienced, and i know it will last us forever. 

i share how grateful i am for you all the time, but it’s important i say it now. in my lifetime, i hadn’t experienced the good deeds of men, much less the good deeds of humans. i thought existing was suffering for those around me. but you showed me different, you showed me things i never knew were possible to feel for another human being. you led me through it, gently as i apprehensively joined you. my eyes were wide with fear and my mind spiraled in terror. yet you stood strong, and reassured me every step of the way. i will never be able to thank you enough for that. and i will never be able to thank you enough for seeing the potential in me, when i lacked the vision to do so myself. 

that’s all for now, i hope you’re doing well.

"So in 2002 I met a boy through my brother's girlfriend. They were f/m besties of 10 years and claimed to only be platonic (no one believed it tho). Anyways,  my dad was always super tough on me and my sister but let the boys run wild. Anywho, this boy finally got to take me on my 1st date when I 15 almost 16. He was so nerdy and shy..I liked that about him.  I only had 1 boyfriend before that but he was a total tool. We go eat then went to a party. Well even tho we're not dating as its a first date, and 2nd time meeting eachother, I expected a little bit of commitment to me for the night.  But, nope. He got drunk (he was 17) and literally had a bj contest in the front yard of this house party. 4 nasty girls sucking him off for clout. I walked up and seen what was happening, but virgin innocent me didn't understand. I called my sister to pick me up. Fast forward a few months after zero contact(before social media) and he hits me up out of the blue asking to hang out. He has no appearent memory of what happened 11 months prior. Again, I'm young and nieve. So I let him take me out again. By now I'm 17 and him 19. We got out to a movie and end up at his place (his parents house). We had a few beers followed by passionate sex in the shower and agian in his parents bed. My 1st (and 2nd) time. He had no idea it was my 1st time...he never asked. It just happened so fast. We hooked up a few more times after that and dated a while. Well, I move and lost all contact with this boy, now man. Fast forawd 15 years. 
He hits me up on Facebook out of the blue. Apparently he took off to the military shortly after we last hooked up and I had a pregnancy scare. He was by this time un happily married and being a single dad. His wife was also in the military but was cheating on him openly whwhile staying fone because she didnt want to be a mom. Somehow they had another baby together 4 years later. 2 years later I  flew out to him where he was stationed and spent the week with him and his kids (babies)while his wife was away cheating.  We hooked up all week, then I flew home. I seriously had the best time with him seeing the ocean,  watching football and just being together.  It felt like in that moment,  i was meant to be there. He made me feel like i was on top of the world, protcted and wanted. 
Again we lost contact as he was trying to save his failed marriage, even though now, technically he had an affair as well. Me being the bigger person and wanting to protect him from getting caught, i cut all contact. This killed me because time and time again the universe worked to re kindle us. Anyways, so I'm home a couple years and you guessed it...he reached out. By this time I was married with 2 babies so I told him no. He left me alone a couple more  years.
 He reaches out agian. By now me and hubby have drifted apart and called it quits while still staying co habitents...beacuse who can afford to be a single parent making $14 an hour...no one.  So Anyways, he says his wife and him are done as well. We take a wonderful vacation together doing the best thing ever(ask me in the comments and I'll tell ya..no not sex, even tho yes there was a tons of that too).  It's time to part ways again as he was still living with his estranged wife in another state. 
Well, he moves to my neighborhood 4 months later!!! We start a relationship and over a few months I realize he is definitely not the boy I've loved all this time. He changed. He is whiny and selfish.
 So,  I go out of state to see family for the holiday... as we both had very different living arrangements due to x's and kids and whatnot it was hard to link up sometimes even though we were literally 3 minutes apart. Our children have become great friends and so now their happiness is all that matters. Anyways the whole time that I'm with my parents out of state he is blowing me up asking me why I'm not talking to him why I'm not FaceTiming him why I'm not giving him attention and it's literally the holiday and I'm with my family. He was being a prick before i left too to travel, or I would have invited him as well because my family knows him.
 And it gets better, after talking and rekindling, it was mentioned in conversation that not only did we start dating in high school when we were young teenagers, but we were also neighbors almost our entire lives and did not know until he told me this when I was 37 years old. This boy now man has literally been in my life (whether I knew it or not) for the past 32 of my 38 years on this planet. 
So back to the holiday thing, when I came back things were just really Rocky and I can tell the shift in him and the change that made me not like him anymore. It was nothing in particular that he did or said, it was just the overall aspect of everything. So obviously we lost contact again even though he lives down the street. A few months after our un-agreed upon separation, he starts dating another person. Not only is he dating the other person but he's rubbing it in my face. And the person he is dating is old enough to be his mother. So now that he has a new girlfriend, I'm not allowed to text him anymore and our children are no longer allowed to have play dates anymore because I'm too much of a threat to her. I would think by this point me and the boy in question would at least be best friends and he would tell his girlfriend that I'm not going anywhere. (even though things are rocky)
 Well now let's fast forward even a little bit more to recent. So now that his family has met his older girlfriend person, he has started letting his daughter come back around my daughter and of course they gossip so I hear everything. Apparently they are pretty serious and he lied to me. A few weeks ago he got into my DMs asking for sex. He has always told me for 20 years now that I was the best sex he ever had.. but if that were true why did he leave so many times? He is only dating his girlfriend to get back at me for not giving him an 18th chance. 
Well one night I was drinking and he sled into my Dms telling me that him and his girlfriend weren't serious and that he wasn't really happy. Of course I ended up in his bed.. five times. Now he has cheated on his new girlfriend 5 times. We would still be seeing each other if I didn't break it off after seeing photos of them on social media happily together at concerts and whatnot. Pretty much looking back I dodged a bullet because this man is obviously a player and has the heart of mud. The way this boy has dragged me through the mud over the last 28 years of my life and has given me false hope and has left me on to believe that one day we would be together like it was meant to be. I know they say that if you can be the bigger person and pretend like you're happy, that's the best way to get back at somebody... but I'm at the point now where I can't even pretend to be happy. Not that I would ever date him because I know he's a player, but, part of me just feels like I lost a best friend I didn't know I had. Like a part of me died. And I have told him this and his only response is"" oh"" .
 He never loved me the way I have loved him. I'll never know what could have been. Now he says that he still loves me,  he wants to have sex with me all the time and that he can see us being married one day and that I was his long lost love.  I guess men will say whatever they have to say to get back in pants.  I'm not the one that got away, he's the one that I left. So now I'm torn on whether I should still be his friend even though he hasn't always been the best of a friend to me....or if I should let his girlfriend know that he cheated....... And if it wasn't for me breaking it off, he would still be cheating on her with me. I finally discovered my worth and I will never ever have interaction with this man again. I got the boy, and she got the boy just 20 years older. I'm so tired I don't know what to do. I feel like I lost my best friend. Talking to him won't help. Same broken tune. Also,  I would never date him again after knowing what I know. And also his girlfriend needs to know. His child and my child are best friends so we do see each other like every other week and sometimes his girlfriend is with them and sometimes she is not. I have never introduced myself as it is awkward as f*** obviously. I don't know what to do. Part of me just wants to get my kids and run away start over with new people.. but part of me knows that I can never leave.  I'm still waiting for him to choose me. The only thing really keeping me from telling his girlfriend about us is the fact that if I do he will not let his daughter visit with my daughter anymore and that would only hurt my daughter and his.   I feel used. Why coukdnt he chose me? I always waited for him....the second he is in my life again, he runs itbin my face that i cantvhave him.Help.

Also..I left breadcrumbs at his home to alert his girlfriend that I'm was there...sadly she never found them...he did and he is mad at me. I feel so guilty and like I'm working on eggshells but I'm not the one doing anything wrong. Men suck",,"r/LoveLetters","2024-10-30T03:37:00.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in 2002 I met a boy through my brother&amp;#39;s girlfriend. They were f/m besties of 10 years and claimed to only be platonic (no one believed it tho). Anyways,  my dad was always super tough on me and my sister but let the boys run wild. Anywho, this boy finally got to take me on my 1st date when I 15 almost 16. He was so nerdy and shy..I liked that about him.  I only had 1 boyfriend before that but he was a total tool. We go eat then went to a party. Well even tho we&amp;#39;re not dating as its a first date, and 2nd time meeting eachother, I expected a little bit of commitment to me for the night.  But, nope. He got drunk (he was 17) and literally had a bj contest in the front yard of this house party. 4 nasty girls sucking him off for clout. I walked up and seen what was happening, but virgin innocent me didn&amp;#39;t understand. I called my sister to pick me up. Fast forward a few months after zero contact(before social media) and he hits me up out of the blue asking to hang out. He has no appearent memory of what happened 11 months prior. Again, I&amp;#39;m young and nieve. So I let him take me out again. By now I&amp;#39;m 17 and him 19. We got out to a movie and end up at his place (his parents house). We had a few beers followed by passionate sex in the shower and agian in his parents bed. My 1st (and 2nd) time. He had no idea it was my 1st time...he never asked. It just happened so fast. We hooked up a few more times after that and dated a while. Well, I move and lost all contact with this boy, now man. Fast forawd 15 years. 
He hits me up on Facebook out of the blue. Apparently he took off to the military shortly after we last hooked up and I had a pregnancy scare. He was by this time un happily married and being a single dad. His wife was also in the military but was cheating on him openly whwhile staying fone because she didnt want to be a mom. Somehow they had another baby together 4 years later. 2 years later I  flew out to him where he was stationed and spent the week with him and his kids (babies)while his wife was away cheating.  We hooked up all week, then I flew home. I seriously had the best time with him seeing the ocean,  watching football and just being together.  It felt like in that moment,  i was meant to be there. He made me feel like i was on top of the world, protcted and wanted. 
Again we lost contact as he was trying to save his failed marriage, even though now, technically he had an affair as well. Me being the bigger person and wanting to protect him from getting caught, i cut all contact. This killed me because time and time again the universe worked to re kindle us. Anyways, so I&amp;#39;m home a couple years and you guessed it...he reached out. By this time I was married with 2 babies so I told him no. He left me alone a couple more  years.
 He reaches out agian. By now me and hubby have drifted apart and called it quits while still staying co habitents...beacuse who can afford to be a single parent making $14 an hour...no one.  So Anyways, he says his wife and him are done as well. We take a wonderful vacation together doing the best thing ever(ask me in the comments and I&amp;#39;ll tell ya..no not sex, even tho yes there was a tons of that too).  It&amp;#39;s time to part ways again as he was still living with his estranged wife in another state.

"Can I make a confession? Everyday I fall more and more in love with you. I know I don't really express it that much around you, mainly because I'm pretty sure you don't want this. What I wouldn't give to be able to act the way I really want to around you, but I know it's not appropriate and it's not fair to you because it's not what you want, unless, maybe you do? It's just that I'm so comfortable around you, and that's a new feeling for me. I always feel the need to act a certain way around everyone, but not you. When I'm around you, I actually feel like I can just be myself, and I've never had that with anyone, even my own family and friends. It's not easy though, sure I can be myself around you, but when I'm with you I'm always thinking about how much I want to hold you close or even kiss you. I know it's wrong, but this isn't just some dumb crush. I really do love you and want to be with you. Truth is, I haven't found anyone else attractive or interesting at all since I met you. You're the only one I want to be with and as far as I'm concerned, everyone else can get lost. You're the most beautiful, cute, compatible person I've ever met and I mean that. I think about you all day and all night, and it kills me thinking you probably don't feel the same way. I don't want to seem manipulative, but I wish I could do something to change your mind, because I think we would be so great together. We communicate well, respect each other's space, we trust each other, we enjoy a lot of the same hobbies and interests. I could keep going, but the point is, I would feel stupid if I just let someone as perfect as you go. I know it's selfish, but I don't want to give up on you, on the possibility of us being together. 

I know the ------ is a problem for you and at first it was for me to, but then I got to know you better, spent more time with you and I can't help but think that the ------ isn't that big of a problem considering everything else between us that just works. If that alone is the only reason you don't want to give this a chance, then I hope you will reconsider. I really do think we could be happy together and I honestly believe I would have no regrets spending the rest of my life with you. I want to make you my wife and I want to be the perfect husband for you. I'm sorry, I know I'm putting a lot of pressure on you by saying all this.

Which is why you'll probably never see or hear me say this. I guess sometimes I just have to let it all out here, because it drives me crazy holding back all this affection and love I have for you and I can't do it forever.

"Hey baby! God, you turn me on today! It's just a gentle pitter-patter of rain on my skylights. I could only imagine you on my couch, my ebony! Somewhat sexy, my mind is running after you on my empty sofa! I was about ready to make a move on your butt butt butt! And that's not a textual stutter. You're hot! But hail is ice, and it cooled me off. I came back in after moving my car into the garage , and I looked at your text, and I said Man, I need to ask my girl if she wants to get a room! Oh hell yes, I want to touch your butt butt butt. I like big butts, and I cannot lie. There I go again!

 I watched this one video, and they're shaking their rump. I think it's called Rump Shaker! My girl in there looks just like you and is phat and dope! Well, I don't want to be overly sexual on this sub, but you are so hot I can only imagine unbuttoning, well, you know, and then kissing you from your head down to your toes and licking them too. Don't shower, and I'll do the same. 

 I'm ready. I know that you've been wanting me for a long time, and I've been wanting you, and we're so far apart that we can only express ourselves through this platform. After all, if it weren't for this place, I wouldn't be able to talk to you in this way and express myself. You're so Vogue. I want to grab your waist and between your legs and spin you around round all the way around, like right around! 

Or, in other words, you turn me right around. That hot dude on the video, I think his name is dead or alive! Well, he's far from finished, I like his music, but I'd instead devour you. I love your two-line text today on another sub. It just really made me realize it was you, and that's why I asked that million-dollar question. Is it you, and you said yes, I knew right away it was you, and I want to well, I'll just say I want to do you. If you feel the same, it's time to consummate our textual relationship so we can move on to the next level.

 I hope I'm not scaring you because you scare me. You're like the Amityville Horror or the Predestination of my dreams. You're a mystery. You're my destiny, and you're humorous too, and I love that about you. Text you hugs and kisses from your cyber lover. Shit, there's the other one, she can wait, it's only you, I swear! Let's get a room, baby! I want your sex!

"People that are ruled by this compulsion will almost always end up having their hearts ♥️ completely, and potentially irretrievably shattered - by none other than themselves. 

Sooner or later, you will run into that ONE person that makes the ground under your feet tremble - and they will love you too. But because you never took the time to do the work and heal, you will engage in the usual patterns and bullshit. 

Your  person will start to become deeply confused and they will start to hurt, but undoubtedly they will give you chance after chance to chance to show up and invest in them. Eventually, they won’t be able to take even another day of the dismissiveness, lack of communication, destructive assumptions, secretiveness, and barely concealed antagonism towards the connection and the other person and they will leave. 

Soon, after they are gone for good and the threat of intimacy with your dream person has been thoroughly destroyed, the deep longing, regret and rumination will start. You will clearly see that the Universe had brought you something that you had always dreamed about, and inexplicably, you reacted as if it was a pair of dirty, second-hand socks. 

It is sad and devastating, but if this happens to you when you are still relatively young, consider it a blessing and begin unpacking the mess that underlies these destructive, self-sabotaging behaviors so that you aren’t still daydreaming about the lost love of your life at 90 years-old in the nursing home.

Just once to only see a smile at the end instead of that look on your face that kills me a little more, watch me crumble in the heat of your hate.

And I can't tell you I love you...once again unrequited and left to stain us, my love for you, is a burden on our hearts that has led us astray. Leaving my memory with a bad taste in my mouth for not having control. Watch me fade away to nothing as my own self loathing leads me to the hatred I harbour inside me, where the blame I have stored creeps up and devours me whole.  For every moment every touch, every single kiss you gave. I Told you I'm sorry and you asked right before our lips met if that were true. I whispered back ""maybe not"" and our lips met and I was consumed by our fireworks,  but right then i knew. You took it much to literally and although that may have been true. Know that, I was not sorry for the moment, for the time I spent holding your rough hands in mine, I was sorry for bothering you again with my pain , it was my own fault....For falling in love with you. sorry to lose my friend once again. And you blamed me this time around.... I never asked for this no but I didn't want you to go either. I didn't want to keep saying goodbye to the person who had been stealing my breath away from the moment you first saved me from the unforgiving road. This is what my heart refuses to admit to you whenever we've been alone....sometimes you're all I see when i close my eyes or think of home and that's a scary thought for me. So instead I'll keep it here amongst so many others letters that were never sent.
And hope that perhaps one day you'll see this and know that I never meant to be cruel or mean when you told me to let it all go.

"Hiiii J!!!

I'm in my new place. My first night away from my abuser. I'm sitting outside as I write this, pulling on a cigarette, drinking a Mike's Hard Lemonade, and thinking of you. 

It tastes like a memory of better times.

We've always had our on and off times over the last two decades, but this time hits the hardest. I suppose because this time wasn't our choice.

I'm reminiscing tonight, thinking of Halloweens long since passed. Our first one, of course, is directly related to Mike's. You know the story, but I love telling it anyway.

High school, senior year. We had only just met a couple of months ago, and you invited me to your house to hang out on Halloween. We were supposed to watch scary movies all night with a small group of friends. I remember showing up and you got into the alcohol. You always were, and still are, a lightweight, and so damned adorable when you were tipsy.

I remember you grabbed a bottle and couldn't remember if it was screw top or pop off. You decided to try and use a bottle opener anyway. I remember seeing your pouty face when a shard of glass went into your drink. I laughed and said, ""Just clinch your teeth when you drink! You'll be fine!"" and your pout grew five times stronger.

It was at that moment I realized, as I gazed at your sad eyes and your stuck out bottom lip, that I was in trouble. I took the bottle from you and quickly opened up a new one to give to you. There is, even to this day, nothing I can do to stop the power of your pout.

We went out to rent some movies, and I had to have my arms around you the whole time to keep you steady. The last thing I wanted was to have you arrested for public intox and underage drinking. We walked around the store looking at horror movies to rent, my hands never leaving your side. It seems I have always wanted to make sure you are safe.

When we got back to your house, somebody in the group decided we should play hide n seek. Naturally, I stayed with you. I didn't go through all the trouble of leading you around the rental store only to let you get injured in your own house by stumbling around in the dark! 

We hid in the bathroom at one point. You stumbled, and I caught you, only this time to catch you, my arms had to wrap around your midsection, and I had to pull you close to me to keep you from falling. Our eyes met, and I could feel electricity in the air. I knew you had a boyfriend, and I had a girlfriend, but they were both long distance and, to be perfectly blunt, barely mattered in that moment. I wasn't sure if you felt the same though, so I pulled away. You huffed, clenched your fists, stomped your feet, and exclaimed, ""Well, are you gonna kiss me or not?!""

It was the pouty face again, and this time with words giving me the greenlight. I. was. fucked.

My arms went back around you, and I pulled you into me. Our lips crushed against each other, leaving not a single crack or crevice for light to shine through. In that moment, everything felt perfect. We fell together like two puzzle pieces, perfectly natural, as if we had been dating our entire lives.

Of course, we spent most of the rest of the night hiding from everyone else and kissing in the darkness. Despite barely being able to see one another in a near pitch black house, our lips never had any trouble finding one another. It was as if they were drawn to each other, made for one another and no one else.

Later on, we did put in a couple of the movies, but I can't remember actually watching them. I was too transfixed on you. I only remember hearing the music in your voice when you would laugh, and feeling you wrap your arms around mine and hiding your face in my chest when you were scared.

When the movies were over, you stood up, and said you needed to go to bed, but you were too scared to walk to your room alone. I'm no fool, I knew you weren't, and I definitely wasn't about to let anyone else volunteer to walk with you. 

I stood up from the couch and walked with you. When we got to your room we kissed, and you said you had to change for bed. You asked me to not close the door because it was scary. Naturally, I turned my back to give you your privacy and to look down the hallway, making sure nobody else came by and saw anything. You told me to turn back around, and with a smile you said you were still scared, and asked if I would stay with you until you fell asleep.

The pouty face again. No turning back now.

I laid with you, and we talked for awhile, and ck tiniest to kiss, as well as other things that I will not write here. Suffice to say, we spent a beautiful time together. You fell asleep in my arms as we spooned. I was out soon after.

In the middle of the night, I woke up, not even realizing I had fallen asleep. I was scared. How long has I been in here? Has anyone noticed I've been gone so long? What if it gets back to your boyfriend? I couldn't risk messing up your relationship, because I did not know how serious it was or wasn't, not how serious we were or weren't.

I slipped my arm out from underneath you, and climbed out of the bed quietly, so as to not wake you. I went back to the living room to find most of the group had left, and hung out with my best friend before we crashed on the pullout bed in the living room.

The next morning, you came into the living room and said ""Good morning boys."" You stretched and then suddenly clutches your chest and exclaimed, ""OHMYGOD! I'M NOT WEARING A BRA!""

We erupted into fits of laughter as you left the room. Shouting to you that it's okay, nobody could see anything. I think you left so fast, and so mortified, that you didn't even hear us.

Once you were ready, I drove you to your performance. Choir or drama, regionals or something like that. After you left, I dropped my friend off at his house and went right back to the school, on a Saturday no less! I picked you up, and we hung out the rest of the day. It was as if nobody else in the world mattered. We would kiss, drive around the little town we grew up in, talking about anything and everything. 

We talked about your future, and what you wanted to do for a career. I can never express enough to you how proud I am for you achieving it. Not only achieving, but excelling! I'm so proud of you Miss Nationally Recognized with Multiple Awards.

I've rambled enough here. I guess, all of this is just my long winded way of saying that I miss you. I love that we had reconnected, but unfortunately we cannot speak right now. I understand, truly I do. Your life and your career I would never ask you to blow up just to be with me. You've worked too hard. I love you too much to let that happen. I wish I could send you this letter, but I am afraid it would only do more bad than good.

I love you. I have loved you forever, and I always will. I know you feel the same. Don't you worry darling, I'll always be here for you, and I don't care if we're 65 when we finally get to be together for good. I'm going to marry you. In the meantime though, you keep being the amazing woman I know you are, and I'll keep working on myself, for me and for you.

I love you J. If you ever need me, you know how to reach me.

-Me",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-06-11T05:19:59.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hiiii J!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in my new place. My first night away from my abuser. I&amp;#39;m sitting outside as I write this, pulling on a cigarette, drinking a Mike&amp;#39;s Hard Lemonade, and thinking of you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It tastes like a memory of better times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve always had our on and off times over the last two decades, but this time hits the hardest. I suppose because this time wasn&amp;#39;t our choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m reminiscing tonight, thinking of Halloweens long since passed. Our first one, of course, is directly related to Mike&amp;#39;s. You know the story, but I love telling it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High school, senior year. We had only just met a couple of months ago, and you invited me to your house to hang out on Halloween. We were supposed to watch scary movies all night with a small group of friends. I remember showing up and you got into the alcohol. You always were, and still are, a lightweight, and so damned adorable when you were tipsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember you grabbed a bottle and couldn&amp;#39;t remember if it was screw top or pop off. You decided to try and use a bottle opener anyway. I remember seeing your pouty face when a shard of glass went into your drink. I laughed and said, &amp;quot;Just clinch your teeth when you drink! You&amp;#39;ll be fine!&amp;quot; and your pout grew five times stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at that moment I realized, as I gazed at your sad eyes and your stuck out bottom lip, that I was in trouble. I took the bottle from you and quickly opened up a new one to give to you. There is, even to this day, nothing I can do to stop the power of your pout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went out to rent some movies, and I had to have my arms around you the whole time to keep you steady. The last thing I wanted was to have you arrested for public intox and underage drinking. We walked around the store looking at horror movies to rent, my hands never leaving your side. It seems I have always wanted to make sure you are safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got back to your house, somebody in the group decided we should play hide n seek. Naturally, I stayed with you. I didn&amp;#39;t go through all the trouble of leading you around the rental store only to let you get injured in your own house by stumbling around in the dark! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hid in the bathroom at one point. You stumbled, and I caught you, only this time to catch you, my arms had to wrap around your midsection, and I had to pull you close to me to keep you from falling. Our eyes met, and I could feel electricity in the air. I knew you had a boyfriend, and I had a girlfriend, but they were both long distance and, to be perfectly blunt, barely mattered in that moment. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if you felt the same though, so I pulled away. You huffed, clenched your fists, stomped your feet, and exclaimed, &amp;quot;Well, are you gonna kiss me or not?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the pouty face again, and this time with words giving me the greenlight. I. was. fucked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My arms went back around you, and I pulled you into me. Our lips crushed against each other, leaving not a single crack or crevice for light to shine through. In that moment, everything felt perfect. We fell together like two puzzle pieces, perfectly natural, as if we had been dating our entire lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we spent most of the rest of the night hiding from everyone else and kissing in the darkness. Despite barely being able to see one another in a near pitch black house, our lips never had any trouble finding one another. It was as if they were drawn to each other, made for one another and no one else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, we did put in a couple of the movies, but I can&amp;#39;t remember actually watching them. I was too transfixed on you. I only remember hearing the music in your voice when you would laugh, and feeling you wrap your arms around mine and hiding your face in my chest when you were scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the movies were over, you stood up, and said you needed to go to bed, but you were too scared to walk to your room alone. I&amp;#39;m no fool, I knew you weren&amp;#39;t, and I definitely wasn&amp;#39;t about to let anyone else volunteer to walk with you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stood up from the couch and walked with you. When we got to your room we kissed, and you said you had to change for bed. You asked me to not close the door because it was scary. Naturally, I turned my back to give you your privacy and to look down the hallway, making sure nobody else came by and saw anything. You told me to turn back around, and with a smile you said you were still scared, and asked if I would stay with you until you fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pouty face again. No turning back now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I laid with you, and we talked for awhile, and ck tiniest to kiss, as well as other things that I will not write here. Suffice to say, we spent a beautiful time together. You fell asleep in my arms as we spooned. I was out soon after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the night, I woke up, not even realizing I had fallen asleep. I was scared. How long has I been in here? Has anyone noticed I&amp;#39;ve been gone so long? What if it gets back to your boyfriend? I couldn&amp;#39;t risk messing up your relationship, because I did not know how serious it was or wasn&amp;#39;t, not how serious we were or weren&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I slipped my arm out from underneath you, and climbed out of the bed quietly, so as to not wake you. I went back to the living room to find most of the group had left, and hung out with my best friend before we crashed on the pullout bed in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, you came into the living room and said &amp;quot;Good morning boys.&amp;quot; You stretched and then suddenly clutches your chest and exclaimed, &amp;quot;OHMYGOD! I&amp;#39;M NOT WEARING A BRA!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We erupted into fits of laughter as you left the room. Shouting to you that it&amp;#39;s okay, nobody could see anything. I think you left so fast, and so mortified, that you didn&amp;#39;t even hear us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you were ready, I drove you to your performance. Choir or drama, regionals or something like that. After you left, I dropped my friend off at his house and went right back to the school, on a Saturday no less! I picked you up, and we hung out the rest of the day.

"Dear W,

It has been quite some time since we last spoke, and I hope you can spare a few moments to read these words I've written for you. I have carried them in my heart for years, and today, I feel compelled to share them with you.

Looking back, it seems like a lifetime ago when our paths first crossed in high school. Those were the days when youthful hearts were filled with dreams and possibilities. Our connection was special, and it seemed like we were destined for something extraordinary. We embarked on a beautiful journey, building memories that I hold dear to this day.

But as life often unfolds, we encountered a roadblock, an unforeseen obstacle that shattered our world. It was a mistake — one that I couldn't understand or reconcile with at that time. The pain was intense, and in my grief, I chose to distance myself from you. Silence prevailed, and our once vibrant romance faded into the background of our lives.

Years have passed, and time has brought about significant changes. Life has taught me valuable lessons about forgiveness, growth, and the power of second chances. I have come to understand that we are all fallible, susceptible to making choices that we may later regret. It is the essence of our humanity.

Today, as I pen down these words, I want you to know that my heart has found peace, and forgiveness has set me free. The anger and disappointment that once consumed me have long since dissipated, leaving space for understanding and compassion. I have come to accept that we are all capable of immense growth and transformation.

I write this letter not to rekindle what we had or to dwell in the past, but rather to express my gratitude. Our time together, however brief, was a significant chapter in my life. It taught me about love, resilience, and the strength to move forward. The experiences we shared molded me into the person I am today, and for that, I will always be grateful.

I hope this letter finds you at a point in your life where you have also discovered the power of self-forgiveness and growth. We all make mistakes, and it is through acknowledging them that we find the courage to become better versions of ourselves.

If you wish to reconnect or even just have a conversation to gain closure, I am open to it. But if you prefer to leave the past where it belongs, I understand and respect your decision. Please know that my intention in reaching out is purely to express my thoughts and emotions, and to wish you well on your journey through life.

May happiness and contentment fill your days, and may you find the love and peace that you deserve. I sincerely hope that life has treated you kindly and that you have found joy in the paths you have chosen.

Thank you for the memories we once shared, and for being a part of my life's tapestry. I wish you nothing but the very best in all your endeavors.

With warmth and sincerity,

"Yes and sort of. The thing is, back in high school and college, we never were both single at the same time. We grew to love one another, but both of us were too scared to say it.

I sometimes wish I had though. We went to different colleges, hundreds of miles from one another. Her in another state, me closer to home.

After we reconnected this last time, she told me, ""I had to keep you at arms length, because if I didn't I knew I'd have to admit I never stopped loving you.""

This has been our cycle for the last 18 years, and the entire time we neither one ever stopped wondering how the other was doing. If they were okay. If they were happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we reconnected this last time, she told me, &amp;quot;I had to keep you at arms length, because if I didn&amp;#39;t I knew I&amp;#39;d have to admit I never stopped loving you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reconnected because both of us were having a hard time in our marriages. We just started talking one night and it snowballed from there. We began healing hearts we didn&amp;#39;t break.&lt;/p&gt;

**When i see you, my heart skips a beat.** 

When i hear your voice, i lose mine momentarily. 

When I am with you, I am enchanted by your words, and your enthusiasm warms my heart.

When I see you smile, or I make you laugh, the butterflies in my stomach set sail through my heart. It really is a beautiful sight..

When you touch me, i lean in closer. 

I want your arms around me. 

I want your hands on me. 

I like the way it feels to lean against your chest. Even if for a moment.. My head feels dizzy and my vision is blurry. 

You always know how to make me smile and laugh, by the end of the night my cheeks hurt. Do yours hurt, too? 

Maybe i could kiss them.. 

Something so simple, an act so small.. what would you do? 

I think about this often. 

Your hugs get longer, you linger a little bit more each time.. you hold me a little tighter.. and all I can think is, “this is it. Please don’t let go.”

What are you searching for, asking for? 

Sometimes. i wonder..

I look into your eyes and its hard to look away. 

I see you smile and my breath hitches. 

Why do you make me feel this way? 

You tell me, you want me to make the first move. 

Would you really let me? I don’t want to scare you off.. 

I don’t want to misread this. I don’t want to mess this up. 

Is this how you feel, too? 

I wonder…

What would it feel like to hold your hand? 

To feel you wrap your arms around me from behind, and snuggle me close. 

Whisper in my ear secrets only meant for us to hear. 

Make me blush, hold me tighter.. 

These thoughts, they linger.. a little more each time. 

Am i catching feelings? It feels more like denial… 

I wonder if i’ll ever gain the courage to ask. 

To take. To give in. 

Am i ready to make this complicated? 

…Maybe that’s a limiting belief. Maybe i’m not ready, yet.. 

I wonder…

Would you turn away? Would you reject me if i asked you for permission? 

I also want to earn it.. give me an opening. A sign. 

Something to let me know that this is okay for you, too. 

Oh boy… I think I like you more than I care to admit.. does that scare you, too? 

I wonder…

Do you look at me, too? 

Don’t take your eyes off me.. 

When I’m not looking, what are you thinking? 

I wonder.

I wonder..

Verse 1:

A cosmic bond that we can't deny

Across the stars, our paths aligned A force so strong, it cannot be denied Our destinies intertwine

Chorus:

We're two hearts beating as one

Our love spans galaxies

We're meant to be together

Entwined in this cosmic destiny

Verse 2:

Like two planets spinning in orbit Our love is eternal and infinite A cosmic dance of love and light Guided by a force so bright

Chorus:

We're two hearts beating as one

Our love spans galaxies

We're meant to be together

Entwined in this cosmic destiny

Bridge:

Our souls were drawn to each other

In this vast and infinite universe Our love, so strong, so pure

It was always meant to be

Chorus:

We're two hearts beating as one

Inadequate at best

A misplaced comma?

And my legs get weak

Just by being near me
You don't need to speak

Of all the things I dream about

"Why is it seven/ almost 8 months later I still think of you late at night curious if you with someone else rn I know you will never see this message so that is why I am sending it. 

But late at night you creep in my mind when my eyes close and search for peace you are there. Clear as day I remember your every feature. I wish I could just forget you. Messaging you to meet was stupid Ik that now. And I was curious to see what your response would be,  subconsciously I already knew you would block me straight away. 

I wonder if you’ve been able to sleep anyone else since our split 
I burned all the pictures of you yet the picture of you in my mind still remains..

How I wish I could tell you all the things that’s has happened in my life. All the insane things seem arbitrary when it comes to being so sad. Late at night I remember, not I but my body how you’d make me feel not just in pleasure but in my heart.. you made me feel alive now I’m just numb again 

sleeping sleeping all the time sleep is my lover now 


I guess I wonder how you walked away from me so easily how you could stand to not meet my lips and my soul again, we both did fucked up things either one we were willing to be taken with accountability 

I’m learning to learn to unlove you with ever fibre of me I fear my heart will never be the same. You will always have a piece of it a piece not even me or another love may grasp hold of again. 

I fear that I may never trust another person with my fragile heart I never want to experience that pain ever again I felt my heart being ripped out my chest strangers telling me I’m to pretty to cry. 

Strangers seeing that I was so deflated and broken the tears stung my eyes when I realised you wouldn’t meet them again. Not in reality not even within a phone screen. 

I loved you so much, so so much and I think you didn’t love me at all 
I feel a hole in my soul like a piece of me has been ripped away. 

My eyes are so glazed over I cannot see another as I did with you. I can not see beauty not without you. 

I miss your body, the way your peppermint smell would linger on my neck and lips. How I’d look into those big brown eyes and see nothing but pools of opportunity, love and of course chocolate my favourite part of you was those lips I kissed many others but no one could set me on fire like you. Compared to you they were sparks that went out as soon as my lips that met theirs. You made me cry happy cry when I first kissed you, I never experienced that in my life you set my soul on fire and you burned for me. Why couldn’t we go back to that. Forget everything that has happened. 


Your the logical one and I’m the emotional one I keep fucking dreaming about you having pleasurable moments me asking when can I see you again and you fading away into dust as I slowly regain consciousness 

But if you think of me, anything at all what do you think ? Do you dream at all do you remember the first night we kissed are you happier without me? 

 are you content are you lonely ? Are you at all regretful are you in love with another are you alone right now are you in a dark room crying like I do ?

"Heh..

I was a fool to believe that I had a chance with you.

I was a fool to believe that those nice things you said in letters were ment for me... but they  seem like they were ment for someone else.

You would think after almost 4 years after the fact i would have learned that you never wanted me in your life. I mean why keep someone at an arms distance then if you didn't have any other intentions of having them in your life?

I swore I would never pressure you or force you to do anything you weren't ready for or wanted to do but..

I wish you would just make a move of some sort letting me know you truthfully do want me in your life. or cut me loose completely so I can attempt to move on. 

and truthfully I don't think youll ever understand that this whole thing has been killing me on the inside. I wish I could tell you but I can't.

"It's not you. It's me

Or maybe it is you, and not me

Maybe it's an us thing

Who knows? 

I was behind you last night. Hands on your back. Working out the kinks. Not the kinks I'd prefer to be working on. This has always been an us thing. 

Dancing around in circles. Proclaiming our unwavering love for one another. Entangled for eternity. Seeing deeper than one might thrust into the other. Toe testing our pool of trust. Knowing we can hurt each other.

We're just friends, right?! Right? As your friend I don't dare say. I dream about the day. The day when I turn our shotguns into a real kiss. The smoke flows from my lips to yours. We may need it that day. For a smoke screen to shelter what transpires after that kiss. 

In my mind, I lick my lips. Savoring every taste, and every memory of you on my skin. I start with a kiss. Then lay you back and turn the night into eternal bliss. A night where you never feel the need to leave again. Your arms are my home. You will forever be the sunrise I can never forget. Imprinted on my life force. The strawberry moon I long for. The one I adore.

Please tell me, am I the only one who feels this? I'm going insane. I need to hear it from you. My shining star. The only one I can see being my forever. My eternity. Cum warm my inner being.

How do you do it!? Manage to say the absolute right things at the right time. I was so down this morning I didn't even send you a good morning text.
But you sent me one instead saying you hope everything goes well today!? Did you feel me pulling away? Getting discouraged? I'll never be able to explain our timing. It always seems so perfect like it was meant to be.

We are always thinking the same things at the same time, it's wild how I can be thinking about doing something with you and you ask me a few minutes later!

You have the most beautiful eyes, I've been looking into them alot lately, I've seen how dilated they are when I'm around! Are mine? Yes you did look extra cute because of it! I did notice. 

Truth is I think we are connected and I think that connection is stronger than anything anyone has experienced before, i think we truly feel each others emotions.

"It's been such a long journey. If you're out there, I really can't wait to meet you. I've been waiting for you all my life. I always thought our first meeting would come sooner. I'm sorry it hasn't. But I hope I can make you happy when it does.

So much has happened in these 31 years. From a tumultuous childhood. An adolescence with no interest in dating. College years fraught with interest, but too scared to say anything. It's called Selective Mutism. I'm filled with things nobody understands. But I know you will. Because I'll love every part of you, even the parts you can't love yourself, and I know you'll love me back in the same way.

I was searching for you like crazy in my early 20s. In all the wrong places. I thought I had failed. I thought I was a failure. I spent years thinking it. I often think about what life could have been like if we'd met then. We could have been together for so much longer. We could have shared adventure, and excitement, and joy. I'm a different person now than I was back then. In some good ways, some sort of inconvenient and unfortunate ways. But truth is, I probably wouldn't have been ready for you in my 20s. Maybe you wouldn't have been ready for me either.

I spent years working on my craft. Working without you, and thinking I'd never meet you. I've been through ups and downs, as I'm sure you have. I've been through therapy and I've discovered that I'm autistic. I've loved so much, and discovered just how much love I hold inside me. I think I'm ready to believe again. I'm ready to meet you, and to share that love. I can't wait.

I'm sure you'll understand, but just know that if I don't share my love immediately, it's because I'm cautious. I've been forged by tumultuous unrequited love and broken friendships. I don't give what's inside me easily. But when I do, I have a lot to give. And just know I welcome any love you have to give in return.

Until we meet, I'll just be here waiting for you. Doing the same things as usual, and maybe searching for you when I can. I know I'll make you happy like no one else, and I trust you'll do the same.

In my opinion it isn’t necessarily unwillingness to change or want to break barriers of past and childhood trauma that seems like the daunting task. Maybe for someone whose never known how the full magnitude of the riight embrace reeling them in and allowing safety to encompass this unraveling… 

It was unwillingness it was perpetual  enabling factors — both parental and social. Ive sacrificed everything for the sake of my relationships, something I hope I learn from. All of this only to end up evolving further than we were intended to. Alone. Looking back, and seeing they’d turned another direction long before I was allowed to notice. It’s an awful set back— hoping those going through this or something similar have a support system to hold them together through it. I’ve bled for my relationships, fought tooth in and nail just to realize I was only fighting myself… the ultimate battle. I’m really alone in this. 

And I’m trying really hard not to be horrified. I’ve never fallen this hard for anyone, I’ve never allowed myself to be this open— this wound is so sore and gnawing so deep— you really did a number on me. Definitely caught me off guard, when I was least expecting or capable even. This truth is unsettling.. I could’ve gone my whole life not feeling this and been better for it. I would rather never have shed those tears, never trusted such deceiving (L)eyes… I will feel this for a very long time.. I don’t think pain like this goes away. I don’t know.. much. Or anything really. I know fucming nothing. Purely intuitive emotion here.. 

I need a break from life, I am almost  reaching the point of enduring for too long. You gave me everything I needed, I thought for us to get better. I hope the next one, appreciates the ways I bettered you. I hope they look you in your eyes —— as cold as glaciers, from what they’ve seen, before and during our time. I hope you’re cherished so deeply that it shatters the glaze cover around your heart and any will to stay guarded. I remember when you’d drift off into fantasy land, you started doing that more often after a very long while. If I really allow myself— I should’ve known. 

I miss kissing the shyness out of your eyes, waking up groggy and confused— just to reach for your embrace. These are our memories. When you’d laugh that flirtatious way, beckoning for a kiss but not daring to ask— sheepish boy! Oh how I adore you… you’re are gentleness and strength personified. To a degree I’ve never allowed myself to see. Our laughter echoing the halls at all hours, the music you’d let me play which you used to love… stopped being true sooner than I realized. 


You knew… and you didn’t care enough. Because sexual convenience was more alluring than the quality of the person could offer? Is that it? Am I sensing this correctly. Everything starts off nice, the amount of times you’d push me away jokingly, because when itd be down time for us after work, I’d be more enthralled by you than anything you could possible display on that damn sad TV… Why was it worth it to keep me in the dark? something around you weren’t mind body and soul choosing.. why jam it in even more? Why now? Why this way, so ice ice ice cold. Never again will I enjoy love without safety. Never again, this naive and unafraid. So willing , and  ready. I would have to walk into the treatment i seek. In which case its probably celibacy from here on out! I’d have a much easier time accepting that as the most probable result if I had support . I was there for your entire family when they asked anything of me. Never said no. 


Granted i was dealing with abusing my medication at the time… taking it at odd times instead of as needed. You know how much I’d lost…you held me together during that absolutely abysmal process of both morning and running from the feeling. You held me together just to dismantle me all over again, but didn’t forget to burn the edges so the pieces wouldn’t fit. You win. Hope that feels good enough to last a lifetime. Hope it’s something new you can use to your advantage until they’re more trouble than you barged for. Any less than perfect Pristine, obedient, successful, ambitious, radically healed and perfect coping mechanism to adversity. They probably have a much better shot oddly enough. Because they’re not me. I’m not worth anything to anyone. Anyth
I need to write an apology meter to myself after this… 

Maybe timing plays a bigger role than we think— I just remember sharing with you how timing was always on our side. If this becomes permanent, I wish I could say I will forgive and all will be said and done. I will try, but I have so many doubts there suffocating me.. of being able to set myself for further disappointment. This painstaking reality really wasn’t on my time this chapter.. I’m hoping I carry the awareness of knowing when 


Please pray for me— I am free falling alone. No one should have to lose their entire support system in the manner and the time that this has happened.. pray for my strength pray for healing to fund me within meditation — the wrong love to be rendered from the icicles in my veins. Infectious. Corrupting. 

Now I understand, you never let me walk away the way I desperately tried because the wanted the upper hand. But for what? I feel like this is another one of situations where we both lose… I just think about the times I had a chance to turn the tables, numerous. You didn’t have nearly as much on your plate as I’m sure you’re setting up for yourself now.. I see why I was the sacrifice.. the weakest link. I could never do you like that.. not by any stretch of the imagination. Anyone who thinks they know our story, their certainty fails them in ways I’m sure they aren’t even comfortable admitting. Because they care, they’re looking out for you. That’s not a bad thing, but even after writing all this. I know, you know I know— our story isn’t allowed to be told correctly. By some imaginary boundary that came out of the closet one day and knocked over all our years of collected souvenirs… I will have to delete all of our pictures soon… and that is going to burn like holy hell water.

I can feel you take breaths, can feel your heart beating against me. Every so often I catch your faint scent, and I inhale deeply in that moment. Seeing your tiny painted toes pressing against the arm of the couch brings a smile to my face. Your legs seem longer than normal as they stretch out from your skimpy blue cotton shorts.

A bond that the Greek god Atlas can't separate will make sweet love that Aphrodite will burn in jealousy!  I would not hesitate to make love to you. In my words, let's spend quality time together basking in the blessings of our shared universe. You are so hot. I can't wait to spend time with your lover.

I want to show you in me, lover girl, our intertwined souls becoming one identity of the male and female masculine. We are like superglue. A bond that the Greek god Atlas can&amp;#39;t separate will make sweet love that Aphrodite will burn in jealousy!  I would not hesitate to make love to you. In my words, let&amp;#39;s spend quality time together basking in the blessings of our shared universe. You are so hot. I can&amp;#39;t wait to spend time with your lover. The villagers will never understand Divinity in motion. They&amp;#39;re too busy mowing their grass, sunshine!  Why be normal? Boringly normal?  It&amp;#39;s a newly created version of us. 
Well, are you going to kiss me?  I miss your bed too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Diggy &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Mirror ✨✨✨✨💋💋&lt;/p&gt;

"I regret meeting you- it costs me everything!
Meeting you was my ultimate dawn falls.
Unfortunately, I almost lost everything.
Thankfully, my sanity is intact and I’m thriving.
I cared for you deeply and trusted you with my life. You took me for granted and abused me.
You disappeared and acted as if it were nothing. For weeks and months on end, I blamed myself, I wondered if I said or did something wrong, which hurt you. 

I read our texts over and over again, looking for clues to identify the issue, but I couldn't find it anywhere in the text messages whereby I said anything awful, or disrespectful to hurt you. 
Upon endless reflection and meditation; I finally realized I did nothing to you, which caused you to behave so erratically- this is all on you and you need to own and deal with your actions. 

Retrospectively, I did nothing to hurt you. I am finally at peace with myself and our situation. Above all, I know your behavior has nothing to do with me- therefore, I no longer take it personally. I am healing and recovering well.
Happily, I say my final goodbye to you today.

"Dear (Girl's Name), 
     I know that what I'm about to say is something that I shouldn't. That being said, I'm going to say it anyway, because it will probably eat me up if I never say it. I love you. Not just romantically or platonically, but as a person in general. You try to be a pure-hearted person which I think is such an admirable trait, and you have a pretty big heart in general. You are fun-loving in so many ways which is something I completely relate to, even though I'm not as fun of a person anymore. You are so upbeat and optimistic which I feel like not enough people are, not even me. No girl has ever made me feel the way you make me feel. I've tried so hard to get over you since February, but all I've been able to do is suppress the way I feel. I know that I shouldn't be saying all this with your relationship troubles going on, but I wouldn't have played with your heart like all these other guys. I would've appreciated you. I know you said that I'm mature and you're still maturing, and it's probably true that I'm more mature than you, but the truth is that I'm still learning, growing, and maturing myself. If there's something that I've learned in the past few months, it's that happiness is worth pursuing. It's much more fulfilling to speak your heart than to hold your tongue. It's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. If I had to think back to before I even met you, to what kind of girl I dreamt of being with, that girl was pretty much you. I'm not saying you're perfect, I know you have flaws. I know I'm not perfect, I have flaws too, but I would try to be as perfect as I could be for you. I didn't write this to pressure you into anything and I didn't write this to say that we should be together, I only wrote this to get this off my chest. I will completely understand if you have a bad response to this, just know that all I want is for you to be happy, even if that means cutting me out of your life. I guess you mean a lot to me. Despite what your response to this may be, I'll still be your friend. Over and above all you need to learn to love yourself more. Nobody in the world can do that for you or fill that void. Also, you need to find a guy (whether or not that's me) who doesn't just love you for your face and body, but who loves you for who you are, which is a beautiful human being. :)

"""I would have liked to get some answers and her side of the story. And I really would have liked to see her at least once, you know.. she seems so mirageous.
I'd like to know the dusty corners of your head, where your darkest thoughts are hidden; the things you've never admitted even to yourself. I think the answers that I'm looking for are hiding somewhere over there.
But I know I'm asking for a lot, sorry.
I know you feel bad because of our history, but I have my share of blame to assume too. You didn't ask anything of me, and I gave you everything. I'm a bottomless well. My water has bewitched you. Tell me, did I leave you with a pungent or sweet taste?
Tell me. Speak to me. Words sound better when they come out of your mouth, once they've danced with your tongue and caressed your lips. You hurt me by ignoring me, or rather, I burned myself with my own clumsiness. I'll never blame you. We're all stupid in our own ways. I think there's a lot you don't want to admit. You cry in the shower, where tears blend into the background. How can anyone lie to themselves so much? (he's such a hypocrite) It's a shame what happened, but it was inevitable. We did our best! Right? I don't know if I should, but, I'm still holding out a little hope that one day we might meet. I think we're two sides of the same coin, but the would mean we'd always have our backs to the other, never face to face. It's comforting to know that somewhere on this planet, a kin soul cares about me. I have a bright little corner in my head dedicated to you.

"&gt; definitely NO privacy

Wow this is relatable AF. Does this bother you? I'm fine with it, personally. Couldn't care less. I've come to terms with it. Having privacy from her isn't an issue for me anymore, even if we don't talk at all and she tries to use it to terrorize me. I trust she'll keep my secrets safe, y'know?

I'll admit, I do think it's kinda weird she felt the need to do it ever, considering how unfaltering my honesty is. In fact very weird and rather possessive and cringe 😬 but I guess we all got our damage. Makes me wonder if she's mad that I'm actually so much more honest than she probably expected hahaha. Wouldn't put it past her.

Especially since I'm 100% certain everybody involved (whoever else that hasn't already abandoned her, that is) is being lied to from all angles by her. Because that's how she operates. Triangulating everybody against everybody else. Making us enemies when in reality we should be friends lmao. We need to start a support group until she gets the help she needs (the help would be a heroic dose of me, btw 😏). 

In any case, everything I wrote is just the truth and she could learn from it but she'd rather be arrogant and pretend she's something she's not because she has to ""win"" this posturing contest between her and I. The one I'm not participating in at all.

I still feel you next to me wherever I am.
I feel you sitting, standing and laying next to me. I feel your spirit and energy with me constantly. I feel your breath on my neck and back.The energy is magnetic and overwhelming. I can’t handle the push and pull— it’s torturous. I try pushing the energy away unsuccessfully. Please go away and let me go and live in peace. Sadly, your spirit lingers and lingers.

I avoid eye contacts to limit the magic effect between us. But, the energy, emotion and feeling supersede all attempts made on my end. Your energy lingers and lingers. The emotions are palpable and feelings are unbearable and sometimes unbalanced. 

I feel your eyes staring at me from afar.
I see the glare, excitement and wonder in your eyes. I also see the sadness and uncertainty in your eyes. The concern and confusion 
In your body language and feel the love, pain, and passion in your soul. The confusion lingers and lingers. 

Even though we are no longer in contact -  your energy has no boundaries and I continue to feel your presence every second of the day and night. I wish you would just go away and let me be. Just like I have left you alone so you may live your life however you see fit!!!

"Dreamt of you. Have plenty of dreams about you. This one was different. I went to grab something I needed. I pulled up the back and saw your  vehicle . Felt my heart racing, vision stated to blur, hands shaking, started getting dry mouth. Walked in the back room and scanned hoping to see you. No one around. I peaked thru the back door window and there you were. Sitting talking with a smile on your face. Wasn’t sure what was happening felt my body going numb. Vision blurry again. Palms sweaty. Pulled the door and walked in. Need to grab what I needed without paying too much attention. Walked across the the floor to grab what I needed. Felt like I had a frog in my throat. Stumbling over my words. I turned around and starting walking back towards the door. Everything slowed down my steps, my body movement, sound came to a halt, only things speeding up was my heart rate. Then it happen I locked eyes with you. Everything came to a stop, everything around blurred but you. Your eyes I missed how beautiful they looked. Locked eyes and felt you deep in my soul. Decided to head your way to say hi. But I couldn’t think straight. Nothing else mattered. It like you had a bright glow around you. Made my eyes squint. Came to say hi then it happen I felt you hand on me. Flowing endorphins feeling flowing free, destroying the damn wall coming out. The pulse of electricity running over my body my skin my hands my fingers my face. 
You make my world stop make my heart pound in excitement . Then like a sci-fi movie I was ripped out of the dream and woke up. I smiled but sad at the same time. First time in while I had that feeling. I know it’s still there. Shit why can’t I have this every day, what can’t I see your eyes every day, why can’t I feel the touch of skin, the softness of your lips, why can’t enjoy a big smile every time I see you, why can’t I just have you right now, why can’t I call you my love of my life. Shit!!!!! Hate feeling empty and loss. Hate feeling dark inside. Hope one day I’ll have you. Maybe one day I can see you.

This all came because I did come by, I did see your car parked outside, I did and look thru that window and saw you sitting there. Glowing feeling your vibe. But like a coward I walked out.  Wasn’t sure what you would say. Wasn’t sure if I could still get that vibe. Felt like I would still be a distraction. Felt like things would get worse. I drove off upset. Looked in rear view hoping to see you. No one fault but my own. 
Fuck me!!! Wish things were different. Wish I had one more time with you.

I guess I’ll just keep torturing myself, I’ll keep destroying what’s inside, put everything back in the dark, lock the door and throw away the key.

Wish I had one more chance to hold you close and tell you I love you.

Missing you. Love you

I went to grab something I needed. I pulled up the back and saw your  vehicle . Felt my heart racing, vision stated to blur, hands shaking, started getting dry mouth. Walked in the back room and scanned hoping to see you. No one around. I peaked thru the back door window and there you were. Sitting talking with a smile on your face. Wasn’t sure what was happening felt my body going numb. Vision blurry again. Palms sweaty. Pulled the door and walked in. Need to grab what I needed without paying too much attention. Walked across the the floor to grab what I needed. Felt like I had a frog in my throat. Stumbling over my words. I turned around and starting walking back towards the door. Everything slowed down my steps, my body movement, sound came to a halt, only things speeding up was my heart rate. Then it happen I locked eyes with you. Everything came to a stop, everything around blurred but you. Your eyes I missed how beautiful they looked. Locked eyes and felt you deep in my soul. Decided to head your way to say hi. But I couldn’t think straight. Nothing else mattered. It like you had a bright glow around you. Made my eyes squint. Came to say hi then it happen I felt you hand on me. Flowing endorphins feeling flowing free, destroying the damn wall coming out. The pulse of electricity running over my body my skin my hands my fingers my face.

"I hate going to you about this. I know I don't have the right, but I can't deal with this myself. I've tried. It's not fair to you. I know that. As I told your mother, I did this to myself, and it's mostly about Asperger's Syndrome. I never thought you owed me anything. Your contribution, such as it was, ended forty years ago and was completely innocent. You smiled at me in church, and, for the record, I smiled back. You had no way of knowing what would happen. Neither did I. I didn't even know it was happening until the depression hit.

I'm here, because I want to tell you what I did, and I want you to respond as honestly as possible. That's it. It's not a scam; it's not a business deal. It's therapy. Nothing more. I don't expect anything from you. I am in pain, and I am frozen. My life has been on hold for six months, and I want it back. I can't do that unless I confront this part.

What happened was weird and complicated, even for me. I won't be offended if you have doubts. I certainly did. But everything I'm going to tell you is true, as far as I know it. Some of it is speculation, but I'll point that out. Some of it will also be uncomfortable. I'm very sorry for that.

For the past six months, I've tried to keep this away from you. Part of me has. Part of me wanted to tell you everything. I've tried distracting that part of myself and tricking it and forcing it down, and it worked for a while. My therapist suggested reaching out to you for a neutral conversation. That's when I sent you the LinkedIn request, but I eventually knew that wouldn't work. Then, I asked my mother to go through the grapevine and ask about you. I wanted to trick myself into thinking I'd contacted you when I hadn't. That got me through March. In April, it started to break down.

I was doing okay in February and March. I seemed to have leveled out. I thought that would be my new normal, just a low grade depression for the rest of my life. But that didn't happen.

I had good days and bad. The worst was December. I lost entire days to it. I had trouble eating, trouble sleeping, trouble working. I probably lost five pounds. January was almost as bad. I punched a wall and broke a knuckle. In February and March, the good and bad days were about even. In April, I started getting worse. I had more bad days, and they were more severe. I saw the direction I was headed. I needed to diffuse it before it got really bad. That's when I decided I had to reach out to you. And I was right. May has been even worse. It's almost as bad as January.

I promise, I won't contact you again after this. I'm going to hate myself a lot for what I'm doing. The guilt and the promise will keep me away. They've always been strong motivators for me. I don't need to worry about tricks and distractions anymore.

That's the first reason I contacted you. The second reason is to hear your response. I don't have any unreasonable expectations for that. You will answer honestly and in a way that best suits your life, whatever that happens to be. But, I need to hear it from you, because I can't move past this part. It hurts too much.

I'll start with Asperger's Syndrome. What Asperger's does to me, specifically, damage to my fusiform gyrus prevents me from reading non-verbal communication, and my brain never receives the signal to release oxytocin in response, so I never form emotional connections.

Imagine you could lose the pain of everyone you've ever lost or everyone you've ever seen suffer, but you would also lose all the love and happiness that went with them. And, not just them. You would lose the closeness of everyone around you now. You wouldn't forget them; you just wouldn't feel anything for them.

Imagine feeling guilty if you try to tell your mother you love her, because you know it's a lie. You don't hate her, but you don't love her. You know it hurts her that she can't hear that from you, but it doesn't change anything.

Imagine knowing, when your parents die, you won't feel bad. You won't feel good. You won't feel. You know this absolutely, because it's happened with people you've already lost.

Imagine standing next to your grandmother's coffin and feeling cheated, because you can't participate in the grief of everyone around you. Imagine going to her funeral *hoping* to feel pain, because it would be *something*.

Imagine being attacked your whole life, because you ""don't want to feel."" Imagine feeling alone in a room full of people when you're with your family. Imagine being on the outside of every group. Imagine being born into this, like being punished every day, but you don't know what you did wrong.

For thirty-six years, that was my life. When I learned I had Asperger's, I had an answer. I could stop feeling guilty at funerals. I was disappointed. I still wanted connection, but I understood the neurology. I was able to accept it, to come to terms with it. That was my mindset last November, before the depression began.

However, it's important to understand that the release mechanism for oxytocin is damaged, not the processing mechanism. I know from pets, that if I can get oxytocin into my system some other way, in their case tactile interaction, that it will work.

This is where we get to you and church and a self-soothing, autobiographical memory. That's just a memory that makes you feel good. It could be anything, first pet, first kiss, whatever. For me, it's you smiling at me. My family went back for a visit about a year after we moved. You and I saw each other before church. You didn't know I was back. We talked. We caught up. We smiled at each other during the service. That was the first time I ever flirted with a girl. I have Social Anxiety Disorder on top of the Asperger's, so that's not easy for me. When you smiled at me, you gave me butterflies.

For forty years, I used that memory as intended. It didn't help if things were really bad, but, as a quick pick-me-up, it was fine. Every time, it gave me butterflies. That's the Asperger's. We can sometimes recall the full emotional effect of an event.

What I didn't know is that the self-soothing part is a release of dopamine and oxytocin. They were giving me the butterflies. I've studied psychology. I took it for the humanities credits and liked it. I use it when developing my characters. I've also used it to research my conditions, but I never researched that memory. I had no reason to.

For forty years, I released dopamine and oxytocin into my system with that memory. As far as I can tell, they functioned as intended: reinforcing memory pathways of that memory and all of the other memories I have of you, because I would think of all of them, and linking them to a positive emotional response. In a neurotypical brain, that wouldn't be the case. The amount of oxytocin from other sources would mostly drown out the amount from the self-soothing memory. In an Asperger brain, especially one with Social Anxiety Disorder, it would be different. Every drop would be noticed.

Around Thanksgiving, I hyperfocused on you. It's a common ADD trait. Usually, it's about a project I'm working on. It's great at work. I can get a lot done. This time, it happened to be about you. When it's about a person, I search for a lot of information online, then stop. I never save it; I never reach out to the person; I just search. I think it satisfies some hunting instinct. That is what has happened every other time. I focused on you twice before. That's what happened. The first time was about twenty-five years ago. I was searching for a lot of people then. I wanted to see what search engines could do. The second time was when I moved to the area. That's when I saw you were married. I still used that memory of you, because I wasn't hurting anyone, but that was it.

When I focused on you this third time, I didn't think anything of it. It seemed like any other episode. I found your LinkedIn page. I think I found your Twitter page. I found that photo of you. You looked good. That should have been it. I should have stopped. Instead, I sank into severe depression. I don't have a history of depression. I had no idea where it came from. Over the course of three weeks, I went from completely normal to crippling depression. If anyone had asked me about you in November, I would have said nice things. I would have said you were someone I had a crush on once. That would have been it. Suddenly, you were the only thing I could think about.

So, I wrote an essay about you. I'm a writer, and it can sometimes clear my head. And it did help. It ended the episode and eased the depression. I thought I was better. But, I had this essay, and it told me the impossible. It didn't say it explicitly, but it did say it. I had to reconcile everything I knew about my life and about Asperger's with what the essay told me. That's when I researched that memory. That was the only thing different about you and every other woman I ever thought about. I found information on oxytocin release and reinforced pathways. Some of it is speculation, but it's reasonable, and it doesn't violate anything. I had a mechanism, and it explained a few things. Minor details, but it maintained consistency. I knew I succeeded.

This is where it gets uncomfortable.

Reinforced memory pathways linked to a positive emotional response is the neurological mechanism of falling in love. Without knowing what I was doing, I fell in love with you.

Again, I did this to myself. I've known that from the beginning. I never thought you felt the same way. You had a neurotypical life. And you did nothing wrong. You don't owe me anything. I don't expect anything from you. Not ever. I want you to understand: I'm not delusional, I'm not irrational, and I'm not stupid. I never thought you would upend your life for me. If I thought that, I would have told you all of this in December. I created this self-contained soap opera. I've tried to deal with it myself, but I can't.

I'm not sure if you understand what I did, exactly. I didn't cure Asperger's. I found a loophole, but it only worked once. I didn't have other self-soothing memories. If I'd spread the oxytocin too thin, it wouldn't have worked. You're the only person in the world I love. Probably, the only one I will ever love. I don't have the time or the associated memories to do this again, and I don't have anyone else in my life like you. You weren't the only woman to flirt with me, you weren't the only one to smile at me, but I used the memory of you over and over for a reason. You were the best I ever found. Honestly, I don't want to love someone else, even if it means depression for the rest of my life.

I want to tell you, the emotion itself is very normal. It's very healthy; it's very stable. It feels a bit like contentment. Apparently, the processing part of my brain works exactly the way it should.

As I said, I'm here for therapy. I was getting worse, and I needed to deal with this part of it. I also needed the guilt to keep me away from you. The other reason is because I can't move on. I create scenarios about you in my head. That's a writer's habit, not specific to this situation. But, every day for six months, I have fantasized that you're getting a divorce.

I hate myself for that.

At the beginning, that was the only thing I could think. Literally. I had days in December when you were the only thought in my head. I have ADD. I've *never* had one thought in my head all day. Later, the fantasies were the only thing that kept me functional. They were the only times I felt close to happy. But I can't stop. I know it's not healthy, but the real answer hurts too much. I pull away from it every time. I've reached the point that I can accept I'm not with you now if I can pretend I'll be with you later. I can't face the idea that I'll never be with you. I know the truth, but I need to hear it from you. I won't listen to it from anyone else, not my family, not my therapist, and not me. You're the person I had to tell, and you're the person who needs to respond. And I hate that. I'm not strong enough to do this myself.

The problem is the Asperger's. I don't have a support system in place. I don't know how to be in love. I've never done it before, and I'm not very good at it. I also don't have anyone around me who can help. My family would want to. I know that. But they can't. They've tried comforting me before for whatever it was at the time. It never worked. I heard the words, but I didn't have the connection to the person. They were just words. I've been given a crash course in the worst part of love with no kind of support. My therapist tries, but she can't do much either.

And, I want my life back. I don't have that right now. I have work and you. And pain that freezes me or leaves me sobbing.

I have a good idea what your response will be, and I will feel like crap for the next few months. Or years. But that's for me to worry about. You will go back to your life, and I will be a hiccup in your day or a blip on your screen. You probably don't believe any of it. I'm not offended. But I know what I did. When I think about you, I can feel it. I can't imagine anything else feeling that good or hurting that much.

I'm not sorry I fell in love with you. I will never be sorry for that. You were the best I ever found, and I will love you for the rest of my life. This emotion is too important to me, and you are too important to me. Depression is a small price to pay.

Once more, I will never reach out to you again, or anyone around you. I will not go near you. I promise.

That's it. I hope you don't hate me, even though I probably deserve it. I'm not horrible; I'm just in pain.

Now, it's your turn. Please respond as honestly as possible.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-05-29T20:01:46.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hate going to you about this.

I would have said you were someone I had a crush on once. That would have been it. Suddenly, you were the only thing I could think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I wrote an essay about you. I&amp;#39;m a writer, and it can sometimes clear my head. And it did help. It ended the episode and eased the depression. I thought I was better. But, I had this essay, and it told me the impossible. It didn&amp;#39;t say it explicitly, but it did say it. I had to reconcile everything I knew about my life and about Asperger&amp;#39;s with what the essay told me. That&amp;#39;s when I researched that memory. That was the only thing different about you and every other woman I ever thought about. I found information on oxytocin release and reinforced pathways. Some of it is speculation, but it&amp;#39;s reasonable, and it doesn&amp;#39;t violate anything. I had a mechanism, and it explained a few things. Minor details, but it maintained consistency. I knew I succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where it gets uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reinforced memory pathways linked to a positive emotional response is the neurological mechanism of falling in love. Without knowing what I was doing, I fell in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I did this to myself. I&amp;#39;ve known that from the beginning. I never thought you felt the same way. You had a neurotypical life. And you did nothing wrong. You don&amp;#39;t owe me anything. I don&amp;#39;t expect anything from you. Not ever. I want you to understand: I&amp;#39;m not delusional, I&amp;#39;m not irrational, and I&amp;#39;m not stupid. I never thought you would upend your life for me. If I thought that, I would have told you all of this in December. I created this self-contained soap opera. I&amp;#39;ve tried to deal with it myself, but I can&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure if you understand what I did, exactly. I didn&amp;#39;t cure Asperger&amp;#39;s. I found a loophole, but it only worked once. I didn&amp;#39;t have other self-soothing memories. If I&amp;#39;d spread the oxytocin too thin, it wouldn&amp;#39;t have worked. You&amp;#39;re the only person in the world I love. Probably, the only one I will ever love. I don&amp;#39;t have the time or the associated memories to do this again, and I don&amp;#39;t have anyone else in my life like you. You weren&amp;#39;t the only woman to flirt with me, you weren&amp;#39;t the only one to smile at me, but I used the memory of you over and over for a reason. You were the best I ever found. Honestly, I don&amp;#39;t want to love someone else, even if it means depression for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to tell you, the emotion itself is very normal. It&amp;#39;s very healthy; it&amp;#39;s very stable. It feels a bit like contentment. Apparently, the processing part of my brain works exactly the way it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I&amp;#39;m here for therapy. I was getting worse, and I needed to deal with this part of it. I also needed the guilt to keep me away from you. The other reason is because I can&amp;#39;t move on. I create scenarios about you in my head. That&amp;#39;s a writer&amp;#39;s habit, not specific to this situation. But, every day for six months, I have fantasized that you&amp;#39;re getting a divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning, that was the only thing I could think. Literally. I had days in December when you were the only thought in my head. I have ADD. I&amp;#39;ve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; had one thought in my head all day. Later, the fantasies were the only thing that kept me functional. They were the only times I felt close to happy. But I can&amp;#39;t stop. I know it&amp;#39;s not healthy, but the real answer hurts too much. I pull away from it every time. I&amp;#39;ve reached the point that I can accept I&amp;#39;m not with you now if I can pretend I&amp;#39;ll be with you later. I can&amp;#39;t face the idea that I&amp;#39;ll never be with you. I know the truth, but I need to hear it from you. I won&amp;#39;t listen to it from anyone else, not my family, not my therapist, and not me. You&amp;#39;re the person I had to tell, and you&amp;#39;re the person who needs to respond. And I hate that. I&amp;#39;m not strong enough to do this myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is the Asperger&amp;#39;s. I don&amp;#39;t have a support system in place. I don&amp;#39;t know how to be in love. I&amp;#39;ve never done it before, and I&amp;#39;m not very good at it. I also don&amp;#39;t have anyone around me who can help. My family would want to. I know that. But they can&amp;#39;t. They&amp;#39;ve tried comforting me before for whatever it was at the time. It never worked. I heard the words, but I didn&amp;#39;t have the connection to the person. They were just words. I&amp;#39;ve been given a crash course in the worst part of love with no kind of support. My therapist tries, but she can&amp;#39;t do much either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, I want my life back. I don&amp;#39;t have that right now. I have work and you. And pain that freezes me or leaves me sobbing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a good idea what your response will be, and I will feel like crap for the next few months. Or years. But that&amp;#39;s for me to worry about. You will go back to your life, and I will be a hiccup in your day or a blip on your screen. You probably don&amp;#39;t believe any of it. I&amp;#39;m not offended. But I know what I did. When I think about you, I can feel it. I can&amp;#39;t imagine anything else feeling that good or hurting that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sorry I fell in love with you. I will never be sorry for that. You were the best I ever found, and I will love you for the rest of my life. This emotion is too important to me, and you are too important to me. Depression is a small price to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once more, I will never reach out to you again, or anyone around you. I will not go near you. I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it. I hope you don&amp;#39;t hate me, even though I probably deserve it. I&amp;#39;m not horrible; I&amp;#39;m just in pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it&amp;#39;s your turn. Please respond as honestly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know, not happening. Fair enough, I&amp;#39;ll just keep dreaming, then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you there. I love you, MJ&lt;/p&gt;

"Dear #######,

You're so special to me, so precious, and I care about you and cherish you so freaking much! I absolutely adore and love everything about you. Your great sense of humor and intellect, your velvety and luscious hair, those mesmerizing rainbow eyes, your beautiful and enchanting smile, that sweet and pleasant voice, your cute and kissable hands...everything about you makes me weak at the knees, you’re perfect. You make me so happy, I can’t help but smile whenever I think about you, which is all the time. I find myself waking up early because for once the real dream is when I'm awake. When I think of ways to write or say how I feel about you my heart feels like it is about to give out and explode because I have so many emotions to express, brewing in there that you conjure up which are begging to be released and shown somehow. Yet no words seem adequate enough, no kiss strong enough, no embrace long enough…

My feelings for you are so strong, and I like you so much that my heart begins to physically ache. Absolutely nobody has ever made me feel this way, so strongly, like you. You're so good to me, so caring, so kind and affectionate…it warms my heart so much, you really are my sunshine. I feel like Goldilocks who just found the perfect bed to lay on. I couldn't ask for anything more, nor do I want to. I'm falling for you and it's so hard that I can feel the gravity of it pulling me apart and that feeling in my stomach as if I'm on a roller coaster. I don't want anything but you, you are all I could ask for and even better. My heart is yours...

P.S The world is ugly…but you’re beautiful to me &lt;3

With the most love,

"You always sent me the most loving and caring messages for birthdays, holidays, or just whenever you wanted to love me in that way. Paragraphs of you seeing a version of myself that I never saw in myself. Thank you for all of the words and love you have given me since we met. 

I can't believe you've turned 30 at all. I've loved you since you were 21. I've loved you all this time and have thought of you with each passing moment. I've always teased you by calling you an old man even though our age difference is really nothing. But I see how young we both were. I thought I had it all figured out, but together I think we were two souls loving each other who were too young to do it properly. You were both my first and second love and have taught me everything I know about love. Lessons of love that I take with me everywhere I go. That's been your gift to me. 

I hope we are both older and a little bit wiser now?  You are an amazing individual and you have added such vivid color to my world with or without having you in my life right now. You are the music I fill my soul with. Every song, every melody in my head has been you.  It's always been you. My sunshine that showed me such warmth and resilience. Just knowing you are out there radiating your warmth makes me happy that I walk the same Earth as you. You are such a kind, compassionate, vibrant soul. You are a loving, supportive, and a gentle man with a sensitive heart that I wish I could have protected better. You are the version of all the things that you saw me as. 

You don't settle for less. You are too much of a dreamer and romantic to settle for someone who does not share the same vibration as you. You have been more true to yourself than I to myself. You support and cheer people on always. You get emotional and insecure and feel your thoughts when that green monster gets a hold of you. But that version of you isn't a monster, it is your younger self being scared. It's okay to be scared! The scary unknown is what makes life exciting, right? I hope your 30s are spent exploring the unknown and not being too scared to dive in to it. I will finish off my 20s that way with that thought in mind. 

I'm sorry for the belated birthday message that I don't even get to send you anyway. You pushed me to become the best I can be. I am forever grateful to you and I will cherish and love you like no other. Even at a distance. I hope the next person to win your heart sees how truly special and one of a kind it is. 

I love you to the moon and back again. 
Thank you for just being you. I'm proud of the version you are and have yet to become.

"Skateboard Hoodies

Hey, Diggy,

I'm lying here on the summer grass, babe, thinking bout you, my homie! I feel like I've known you all my life. You are so doddy and looking naughty. I remember doin' the fukcking skateboard park. You always were an excellent half-piper and laser-flipping bitch so dope! Trying to be as good as you, I constantly trashed myself, and you always laughed your ass off at me!

 You were always there for me when I fell, reminding me, ""If at first, you don't succeed, dust yourself off and try again!"" Our badass song we listened to. You were so hot, flying like you were defying gravity, dawg! The roar of the wheels, your feet leaving the board. Ronda Rousey has nothing on you, babe! 

The boys can look but not touch! Remember to Mow the banger that through his slushy on you? I'll kick his gang ass for you! Your mine, girl Ha! Your big ass Bumpboxx on your left shoulder when we walked, we owned our park together. Ain't nothing but a G thang. I like how you cranked the fucker up. Loud and proud was what you said!  You make my heart skip beats. I like big butts, yours. I cannot lie! One thing I appreciated bout you, my homie, is we both pulled our pants up,

Who the fuck thought of wearing them around their knees  fucking bitches what little bitches! Uhh!  Well, I'm glad you didn't hide your fine butt from me! You flaunt it deservingly. You earned it! I always thought. 

You were always eye candy on my arm next to me. You were so hot. I have your undies hanging next to my picture of you in my room! Ha,  By the way, remember to wear that dope hoodie that we both like to like tomorrow for me. I'll wear mine, too, then we will match twins! I'm in love witcha ya, baby! Bring your Slim Shady too. I love you.

"Dear you!!!

I held onto you for dear life because I was petrified. No matter how tightly I held onto you,
I still lost you. The loss is permanent and painful.

The loss transcends into an emotional and physical pain- I feel it every second of my waking life and it is torturous. The level of pain I feel is indescribable- it’s debilitating and paralyzing- I can barely function.

I am sorry if I suffocated and hurt you in anyway, shape or form. That was never my intention and I sincerely apologize for that. My intense nature prevailed even when I tried to hide it- somehow, the intensity emerged despite of my struggle to lessen or hide it. Unfortunately, that’s who I am. That’s why I keep most people at a distance. I love deeply and with every depth of my heart and soul. I warned you!

Above all, when I met you I had came into a new and unwelcome environment; I was frightened, apprehensive and didn’t trust anyone. You seemed so genuine and welcoming- I was happy to meet you. You demonstrated a genuine interest in wanting to get to know me. You felt familiar and were supportive. We bonded instantly- it was magical, yet supremely surprising given how careful and private I am. You broke down my walls effortlessly and I surrendered completely.

I loved our connection- I showed you my vulnerability and authenticity, because I felt safe… You made me feel safe and in turn, I cultivated a safe place for you as well. But, this interaction or connection was only meant to be brief. I will never know the reason we have crossed paths. It is the end, I accept it and agree to move forward. But, it hasn’t been easy.

"Memorial day. I hope you're resting. 

I wonder what you're doing today. Then I stop because I don't like what my brain comes up with. 

But I hope the weather's good so you can enjoy the sun. I stopped checking because I need to try to let go of some things. I'm not succeeding though. 

I know some things haven't been easy for you and I really do hope this will go well. I know it will and you boys are going to be just fine. 

Have you been eating well? Are you exercising and taking care of yourself? Please do. I would do it if I could. You know I would. 

It's a holiday here too, I'm home wishing you were here. Longing for your presence, drowning in regret, begging the gods to allow me go to back in time and change everything. 

I'm just here, existing. But I hope you're living. You deserve it. I love you.

"# Hungry Wolf

Eyes meet across the room,

Her scent stirs my primal desire,

Pure Femineity.

Her steps soft unsure,

Her heart racing with every beat,

Her hot breath under my skin.

In her eyes,

There is a flicker of fire,

A hunger likens to mine.

I'm after her I'm on the hunt,

I'm hungry like a wolf.

Wildly chasing my heart's desire,

She's on fire.

Two equals in need.

She evades me,

I want her.

I'm hungry like a wolf.

"I know you love me

As a friend

We are intertwined

Shall we cut the thread

Together we can part

Make a brand new start

Away from one another

I know I can't watch you love another

I do want you happy, even if it's not with me

You've let me go before, so easily for another

You promised me forever knowing you didn't want it

I can't sit alone anymore, I feel hallow and a shell of what once was

I forever hold my love for you, even though it's killing me

Are you ready to let go, or fight for me

You never kept us sacred before, I wasn't your favorite whore

I can whore now but I'm still not yours

Tell me to fuck off, that I'm still a platonic love

I'll cry one last time. Before laying under someone another night

It's all I know now, the lonely life

Just promise to hug me one last time

Be firm in your goodbye. I'll be okay. I had to be the first time",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-05-26T06:10:15.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know you love me&lt;/p&gt;

"Hey you!!!

I dreamt of you earlier today for the first time in months since you ceased all communication. In the dream, I noticed returning to a common place and saw a few people there. I chitchatted with J. then asked for everyone, including yourself- I was told that you will be getting married in about three or four months.  I was surprised, but I couldn’t bring myself to ask who the lucky girl was/is. I was shocked to hear that news, but not devastated, I smiled, concealed my feelings and reacted accordingly to the news. As the dream ended, I subconsciously and subtly noticed you standing in the background, in a cluttered place and your face was blurred- I felt you saw me and hid from me. Then, I told J. to congratulate you on my behalf. If that news is true, that would explain your erotic behavior. Usually, when I dream of something- it usually comes true and reveals the answer that I have been searching for since the beginning. The dream has a lot of significance, but I will not discern or disclose any of the details about it here! This letter will remain unsent.

"Dear Maria

I have never written something like this and never thought I would.....

It took me a lot of time to get my thoughts together and write it.

I thought a lot about if I should write it or not.....

I know we said that we should stop communicating, but as always I decided to follow my intuition and write it.


If someone had told me before I met you:
""John, soon you will meet a special woman, fall in love with her without realizing it, lose control over your rationality, and after that shed tears over a piece of paper with a pen in hand, thanking her for being short but sweet part of your life and learning a valuable lesson.""

I would have told the person:
""Sir, you need a psychologist! 
First, I don't want this.
Second, I have always had control over my emotions and rational thinking. 
No way that will happen to me!""


Well....


As a person who loves philosophy a lot,
I can not agree more after all this with the famous philosopher Plato.

""Love is a serious mental disease.""  

You might ask yourself, why I am writing this letter?

I wrote this letter because after we decided that we will not share a future, I was left with unspoken words and suppressed feelings that I wanted to share for good or bad.
I didn't have the time to assimilate and say everything to you when we last met.
I didn't write it with the hope that you might change your mind because I could feel that you were not feeling the same way as I did, and you made the right decision for yourself. 


YOU CAME IN UNEXPECTEDLY!

YOU CAME INTO MY LIFE WITHOUT A WARNING AND GUIDE ON HOW TO HANDLE YOU! 

YOU CROSSED THE BORDER AROUND MY HEART WHICH I DID NOT WANT ANYONE TO CROSS! 

YOU CONTINUED, REACHED, AND CHANGED MY SOUL WITHOUT MY PERMISSION AND AGAINST MY WILL!

I DID NOT WANT SOMEONE LIKE YOU IN MY LIFE NOW! 


But....



THANK YOU!

THANK YOU FOR COMING INTO MY LIFE!

THANK YOU FOR BEING YOURSELF!

THANK YOU FOR BEING HONEST!

THANK YOU FOR REVEALING YOUR SOUL WHICH HAS SEEN A LOT OF STRUGGLES!

THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME SMILE!

THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME LAUGH!

THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD MEMORIES!

THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME OUT OF MY HEAD AND MAKING ME ENJOY THE PRESENT!

THANK YOU FOR THE EXCITEMENT YOU BROUGHT INTO MY LIFE!

THANK YOU FOR CAUSING FRUSTRATION AND CHAOS IN MY LIFE!

THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING! 



If you ask me whether I regret meeting you?

No!
Absolutely not!

Throughout my whole life, I had never experienced something so exciting, wonderful, and uncontrollable.

I am glad that we crossed roads even though not for long.

I enjoyed every moment with you!

Even though you decided that we are not for each other, I know that it wasn't easy for you either, I could see it in your eyes....
Your tears didn't lie....

I am not mad or angry at you.

You did not have to feel sorry or apologize for anything!
You have not done anything wrong, you followed your heart as I did.


Don't worry about me.....
I am not heartbroken.....
In fact, I feel the opposite of that. 
I feel joyful and relieved.
I am absolutely fine because I believe and realized that love lives inside us and we have to learn how to love ourselves first and then find someone with whom we can share it, someone who deserves it, someone who will take care of it and respond with the same. 


We live in a beautiful and simontenusly cruel world, full of good but also ignorant people who will try to hurt or use us for their benefit.
With that in mind, I have sent you a symbolic gift with the message ""Love Yourself"" because I want you to always remember that you are a very valuable person who is caring infinite kindness, compassion, and empathy and you should protect these traits at all costs by loving yourself first, taking care of yourself and not allowing others to treat you terribly. 

I hope you will keep this gift safe! 


So dear Maria,
I will forever remember the first time picking you up from the station. 
You were standing there cute and concerned ...
I stopped with the car and said to you through the window:

""If you are scared, you can sit in the back!""

You smiled charmingly and hopped at the front. 

Neither of us knew on what trip we were about to go when I picked you up....

I hope you enjoyed the unforgettable and heart    -shacking journey because for sure I did! 


You might ask yourself by now what lesson I was talking about at the beginning. 

There is a famous quote from a famous psychologist Sigmund Freud. 

""We are never so vulnerable as when we love....""


True...
I have never felt so vulnerable and helpless over my emotions in my life!
That was a hell of a lesson!


So dear lovely person and friend, life goes on....

We should continue on our journeys and chase our dreams persistently and fearlessly because life is too short.

The time spent with you was priceless.



I feel now that I have said what I wanted to say and I hope when you read this letter to reply to me that you have received it as it is important for me these words reach you. 
I don't expect you to reply with anything,  just ""Thank you for the letter"" is enough. 

You will forever remain a blissful memory in my life. 

I hope this letter will reach you, melt your heart, and stick forever in your soul as a blazing reminder that you deserve a lot of love because you girl............
deserved every second spent on it!

&lt;p&gt;YOU CAME INTO MY LIFE WITHOUT A WARNING AND GUIDE ON HOW TO HANDLE YOU! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YOU CROSSED THE BORDER AROUND MY HEART WHICH I DID NOT WANT ANYONE TO CROSS! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YOU CONTINUED, REACHED, AND CHANGED MY SOUL WITHOUT MY PERMISSION AND AGAINST MY WILL!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I DID NOT WANT SOMEONE LIKE YOU IN MY LIFE NOW! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR COMING INTO MY LIFE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR BEING YOURSELF!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR BEING HONEST!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR REVEALING YOUR SOUL WHICH HAS SEEN A LOT OF STRUGGLES!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME SMILE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME LAUGH!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD MEMORIES!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME OUT OF MY HEAD AND MAKING ME ENJOY THE PRESENT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR THE EXCITEMENT YOU BROUGHT INTO MY LIFE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR CAUSING FRUSTRATION AND CHAOS IN MY LIFE!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask me whether I regret meeting you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No!
Absolutely not!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout my whole life, I had never experienced something so exciting, wonderful, and uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am glad that we crossed roads even though not for long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed every moment with you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though you decided that we are not for each other, I know that it wasn&amp;#39;t easy for you either, I could see it in your eyes....
Your tears didn&amp;#39;t lie....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not mad or angry at you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You did not have to feel sorry or apologize for anything!
You have not done anything wrong, you followed your heart as I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t worry about me.....
I am not heartbroken.....
In fact, I feel the opposite of that. 
I feel joyful and relieved.
I am absolutely fine because I believe and realized that love lives inside us and we have to learn how to love ourselves first and then find someone with whom we can share it, someone who deserves it, someone who will take care of it and respond with the same. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a beautiful and simontenusly cruel world, full of good but also ignorant people who will try to hurt or use us for their benefit.
With that in mind, I have sent you a symbolic gift with the message &amp;quot;Love Yourself&amp;quot; because I want you to always remember that you are a very valuable person who is caring infinite kindness, compassion, and empathy and you should protect these traits at all costs by loving yourself first, taking care of yourself and not allowing others to treat you terribly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you will keep this gift safe! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So dear Maria,
I will forever remember the first time picking you up from the station. 
You were standing there cute and concerned ...
I stopped with the car and said to you through the window:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you are scared, you can sit in the back!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You smiled charmingly and hopped at the front. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither of us knew on what trip we were about to go when I picked you up....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed the unforgettable and heart    -shacking journey because for sure I did! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might ask yourself by now what lesson I was talking about at the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a famous quote from a famous psychologist Sigmund Freud. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are never so vulnerable as when we love....&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True...
I have never felt so vulnerable and helpless over my emotions in my life!
That was a hell of a lesson!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So dear lovely person and friend, life goes on....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should continue on our journeys and chase our dreams persistently and fearlessly because life is too short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time spent with you was priceless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel now that I have said what I wanted to say and I hope when you read this letter to reply to me that you have received it as it is important for me these words reach you. 
I don&amp;#39;t expect you to reply with anything,  just &amp;quot;Thank you for the letter&amp;quot; is enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will forever remain a blissful memory in my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this letter will reach you, melt your heart, and stick forever in your soul as a blazing reminder that you deserve a lot of love because you girl............
deserved every second spent on it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From:
Your exclusive boy&lt;/p&gt;

"“The Sirens Song”

The sirens silhouette glimmered 

In dark-blue/deep-blue; 

As the tides swayed through. 

~~

The sun, now at rise

Paints her unveiling with hues.

Dancing are pinks, and lavender dews.

~~

The spectra so brilliant, 

It served as a mask.

For sad is the siren, 

Who took one more glance.

~~

Peering through light, 

At the travelers space,

What once was seen silent

Now a whispering hmm….

~”For the sounds cross the sea, 

Turning words into sung.”~

~~

Elated! “Dear traveler …”

Is how this symphony greets, 

This hmm, turned to song 

Let’s the melody seep…

~~

“My songs come to thee, 

In the nights, they decree”

My traveler. 

My sea.

My heart, you hold the key. 

~~

A brazen toned softened

Before a rapturing plea, 

A pitch-less testimony 

From sirens’ lips, to the sea…

~”you hold what you seek”

Dear traveler, 

Please see! 

Your heart.

Your love, 

Be your sirens’ happy. ~

I hope to see you, I can't wait to hold, to kiss you, to push you up against a wall, and love you in the most romantic and passionate filled moment of intimacy I can muster.

Let's just hope all goes according to plan. If not, then it's okay! Cause I just simply will try again the next chance I see a window of opportunity for me to do so.

"Forever in your orbit but never able to fully reach you. My heart knows no other the way it knows you. I don't think I truly loved before you and I don't think I've truly loved after you. I told you nobody would ever be able to compare to you and I believe that now just as much as I believed that then. There's no searching for what we had because I know it will never be replaced. Still I try to move forward and grieve what we had. But I don't want to settle when it's you my heart feels alive with. Love that is not from the soul is not love I want. The dream of us is the one I refuse to give up. 

I'm sorry you thought I discarded you like rag cloth when I told you I didn't know how to have you in my life. I was terrified and I was blinded by hurt. I thought you gave up too easily when things got hard and it sent me into a panic. I shut down completely because I didn't want to be abandoned. But I abandoned myself and I abandoned you.

I cried to my mom all about it back then. She told me the people we love will test our triggers and our deepest insecurities but if they are worth it then we will work past it. I think you tried to tell me that as well. I was too selfish to realize that what you did was hurtful but the extent of my pain was not your fault and shouldn't have been your burden. I should have listened to her when she told me to fight for you.

I wish I hadn't been so stubborn and unreasonable. So unwilling to budge on what I felt. If I knew then what I know now, our love would have been unstoppable. I guess that's the bittersweet feeling of growth knowing just how much I failed our younger selves. 

But if growing and healing meant I had to lose you again, then I am forever sorry it had to be this way and I am eternally grateful for you and your soul that awakened mine.

I never gave up, merely respected what it was you wanted. In the meantime, I have been putting my soul to the test. Searching in myself and asking what it is I truly wanted.

Someone who has similar interests as me and the deep level of understanding one another. Attractive, adorable, as childish and silly as I can be at times.

Every thought matched you, and every question was answered with you.

You'll see me again, and this time, we got it. Life will be a breeze with us as a team.

"Your surface is shades of beautiful bright reds that show an alluring confidence and excitement. A passionate red that pulls you in. Seductive reds from your devious and playful nature. You show the world your red mask but through the surface I find you in blue. Your reds fade softly into the blues of your soul. 

There's a loneliness inside of you. You are out of reach. You make yourself out of reach. Dark midnight blues that are filled with both sadness and a longing of love. A soft blue of your sensitive dreaming soul. Soft blues shocked into the chilling blues of your fright and insecurity. 

You are both red and blue. Everything you are is everything you aren't. A universe exists within you. A universe I wish I could be a part of. 

Nobody else will ever see the colors of the universe I see existing within you.

"Oh Sweetie, I’d give you everything. You can heal and reflect and decide what to do with your life. I’d be supportive and kind. 

And I’d never be jealous, so I won’t be crazy. 🤪

Anytime you want. Come through that door and everything is yours. I’d sell the house. We could move back if you want. I’d drop everything to accommodate you. Both of you. 

I miss you so much I think I am going crazy. I loved you my whole life. Not a day in our 25+/- years apart did I not think of you. I bet you can’t say the same. 

We both claim the other is “the one that got away.” Well, I’m standing still as hell. Frozen in place and waiting. It would be easy to catch me. You know the door code. Please do come in. 

Un-fuck your life. Come be happy and loved. Give us the chance we always deserved. I will never stop trying to make you feel happy and loved. 

Oh how I am so very fond of you, sir. No “maybe” penciled in this time.

"Here I am, in summer, just as I've been a year ago and all of those before. Except today, the world is bright, coloured with bright oranges, inviting pinks and burning reds. Where the hotness of the sun used to give me headaches, it now fills me with pleasant exhaustion. Today, the warmth in the air floats around me like an upbeat song, and smells of all the good things in the world. Here I am, in summer, happy at long last. I'm at the end of the journey, and though I know there is no happily ever after, I've never felt more at peace. There was a time, lifetimes ago but only just a year from now, where the past troubled me, where the present slipped through my fingers and the future seemed unbearable. There was a time where I was in love with you.

This is my farewell. Farewell, to the feelings that I once desperately clang on to. Farewell, love, and thank you for all that you have taught me. Farewell, love, and thank you for making me into the person that I have become. Though the pain spread through me like poison, and turned me rotten on the inside, I've come out stronger, happier, and better. That is why, my unfortunate companion, I regret nothing. All the love that I held heavy in my heart is gone, all the hate that I had for myself has been replaced with pride and wonder. Farewell, love, and thank you for all that I discovered through you, the wonderful stories and the magnificent songs that at a time, I kept going back to, just like I kept going back to that precious someone who I've come to realise was never more than the ghost of a friend long gone. Thank you so much, love, and farewell.

I hope you fare well, love, wherever you are now. I hope that our futures, now untangled from each other, will be everything that we used to hope for back when we were young and in love. Beautiful. Exciting. I hold such dear memories of you, and I will always cherish them. Farewell, my long lost friend, and thank you for being there at a time of my life where I wasn't quite here. Thank you for everytime you made me laugh so hard I cried, for all the adventures that we had together, for all the compliments that you gave me. The memories that we made together, that I see in the streets when I walk around the city. From now on I promise, I'll always look back on them with a smile. You know, love, even though this is a goodbye, you'll always be a part of me - in everything that you made me discover, in all the things that you opened my eyes to. Thank you, so much, and I hope you fare well.

Now, free from my obsession with you, I can finally look towards the future. A future in which I'm at the center of everything, grown, confident, empathetic, smarter than I used to be. A future which I'm sure will not be without challenges, but that I now for sure know will be worth it all.

"Dear JL,

It’s 5am on Monday morning. I’m still at work tying to wrap things up and prepare for the incoming day shift. Like most Mondays for the last few months, I’m distracted. Only it’s different now. 

Mondays and Fridays were the days we saw each other most. Before and after a weekend without each other. But Mondays are the worst. 

A should be thinking happily of you and your morning visit. I should be planning what outfit to wear (role play and all) and which thigh high socks or stockings to wear for you. I should be thinking about the breakfast you would cook me. About hugging your head and feeling those lovey feelings melt away everything bad thing that’s ever happened. Dreaming of you pressed against me. I should be reveling in the joy and peaceful calm that always accompanies you. 

You are my happy place, my home. 

So many Mondays I stayed awake after work. Knowing I had to go back that night. I sacrificed my sleep to be there with you. It didn’t matter. Being with you was all that did matter. So many Mondays making wild love in my bed. So many giggles and sighs and screams. So much happiness and love. 

No one is like you. No one will ever be like you. Not in my past and there’s no hope for the future. I’d give anything to turn the corner onto my street and see your little, white rat car in the driveway. 

But, you. You’re completely silent. I get it, I do, but it still hurts like hell. 

Do you hate me now? Do you think of me on these days like I do you? Do you miss me and the time we shared? 

Did you ever really care for me at all?

I’m eternally sorry for everything that happened. Truly. I would prostrate myself before you and beg forgiveness. And I would grant you the same forgiveness. 

Forgiven and forgotten. You are forever welcome in my home and my life. But I have a feeling I’ll never see you again. Prove me wrong baby. Please. 

I miss you to the point that I’m sick. I worry about you; Are you working? Are you well? How’s your leg? How’s your mental health? Are you even alive? 

I’ll wait for every single morning until I pass from this world.

Miss you babe. 143 as you like to say. 

Always,

"My dear sweetie, ⭐️

No more calls. No more crazy mean texts from a burner app. I’ll stop on all the social media I’ve stalked you on. All of it. I can’t believe even your Apple Music is gone! I was listening to your playlist and I had one that I’d made for you when we first reconnected. 

You clearly are choosing this. I get it. You’re protecting your kid. You are an awesome dad. 

I was mean and nasty and said the worst things, spilled secrets and threatened to expose you. I didn’t. I couldn’t. I was just trying to get your attention. Did not work. Regret every word with all my soul. It didn’t occur to me that you might be hurting too. And my actions made it worse. I didn’t mean to make it worse. I was so angry. 

I told you this would happen. I kept telling you that I’m not real. I don’t get picked. That I’ll never be the one no matter how much we both might want it. 

You’re completely silent. How can you even do that? I’m so desperate to hear your voices and see your face I’m watching the doorbell cam videos. 

We talked about you in our group text. Everyone is concerned. You’re missed there too. 

I’m worried. First, I think you hate me now. Which you’ve every right to. I’m also concerned about your health. Are you clean? How about the clot in your leg? Your stomach? And what about your mental health? That worries me most. I can’t imagine she’s making this easy for you. I truly hope you’re ok out there. I’m worried and I miss you so much I have literal heartache. 

If you ever get impulsive, if you need to run away or need anything, absolutely anything, anytime in this life, I’ll still be right here. Everything forgiven and forgotten. You will always be welcomed as an old friend and treated with the utmost kindness and respect. Welcome anytime. Days from now, weeks, months, even years. 

After a dead husband and you, I’m not doing anything else. I can’t trust anymore. I don’t have the heart for it anymore. I’ll always just be sitting here waiting. Hoping you will see these letters and realize you forgive me and come see me. 

And not to be mean, and I’m not wishing it on you, but if you’re relationship doesn’t survive this crisis, I’d love to finally give us a real chance together. I think we deserve it. We’ve always deserved it. 

I’m working on healing. I’m getting better. I hope you are too. I miss your stupid fucking face.  

I am very fond of you, sir.

Entered my life frenetically and unexpectedly. Pretended to care and forced yourself through. Couldn’t even stop you even when I tried. Accepted you blindly as if I’ve known you for years. Granted you access without any questions. Turned out you were untrustworthy and a foe. Thankfully, it was a brief encounter, but the damage has already been done.

You are the reason I live, the reason I love. Yet it pains me to know you do not love me the same. Love is a word with so many flaws. If only I could count them all.

I wish you opened the door today, I was there in my dad's car. Your car was there, and yet no one came to the door. I realized the roses, card, and playlist was sent to the wrong house. If only i knew sooner.

I knew I would cry if I saw you, wasn't expecting to cry from not seeing you. I miss you, my dear Kit. I miss you more than you could ever even know. I sometimes wonder how you are doing at school and work. You came a long way and still have a far way to go.

I wish I could stop caring for and helping those who don't give a flying shit about me. You being the one exception.

Kit,                                                                                                                                                       May 15th, 2023

A million years of love could feel like a billion years of pain. One day of pain could and can feel like a thousand years of regret.

I love you, you idiot.

Kit,                                                                                                                                                       May 16th, 2023

""I am helpless for you, pliable to your every will despite myself.""

\-Person from Tumblr

I love you, yet I don't fully understand why. I love you so so much. I love you so much I even forget my words. Sometimes I picture writing to you from war wondering what I might just say. Hoping I come back safely to you, or perhaps the world wasn't so cruel. Sometimes I picture us as two lost souls in the Victorian era. Not for hoping the world to accept us, but for hoping the letters would find their way to you one day. Pretty stupid huh?

&lt;p&gt;You are the reason I live, the reason I love. Yet it pains me to know you do not love me the same. Love is a word with so many flaws. If only I could count them all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you opened the door today, I was there in my dad&amp;#39;s car. Your car was there, and yet no one came to the door. I realized the roses, card, and playlist was sent to the wrong house. If only i knew sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew I would cry if I saw you, wasn&amp;#39;t expecting to cry from not seeing you. I miss you, my dear Kit. I miss you more than you could ever even know. I sometimes wonder how you are doing at school and work. You came a long way and still have a far way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could stop caring for and helping those who don&amp;#39;t give a flying shit about me. You being the one exception.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kit,                                                                                                                                                       May 15th, 2023&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A million years of love could feel like a billion years of pain. One day of pain could and can feel like a thousand years of regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you, you idiot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kit,                                                                                                                                                       May 16th, 2023&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am helpless for you, pliable to your every will despite myself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Person from Tumblr&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you, yet I don&amp;#39;t fully understand why. I love you so so much. I love you so much I even forget my words. Sometimes I picture writing to you from war wondering what I might just say. Hoping I come back safely to you, or perhaps the world wasn&amp;#39;t so cruel. Sometimes I picture us as two lost souls in the Victorian era. Not for hoping the world to accept us, but for hoping the letters would find their way to you one day. Pretty stupid huh?&lt;/p&gt;

"The aftermath…….

The self cleansing, self-awareness, spiritual awakening and sense of relief I feel after the fact are astounding perhaps it was possible, after completely surrendering and letting go. I never imagined that day would come so soon.  At some point, I begged, hoped and longed for it, but I started manifesting it and then it’s finally here. I am beyond elated and speechless, wow! 

I can’t believe the depths of peacefulness and joy that I feel within. The whole energy and instant connection were demoralizing and severely paralyzing and frightening. The entire interaction was demonized and served ONLY one purpose.  I prophetically warned and expressed the reason our path crossed. Re-read the text messages and it’s there in plain text for view. Blessings!

Retrospectively, it was a karmic connection. For that, I’ve paid the most serious consequences to date, simultaneously, repaid my dues consecutively.  To live abundantly and in high frequency, I walked away. I disappeared since I have more opportunities than you. You depend on it for your survival and growth. The lack of educational and financial resources are certainly frustrating and the sheer suffocation and resentments were on full display; I knew that- there were no other alternatives.

"I don't think I'll ever be able to trust someone who says ""I love you"" to me. If you, the person I trusted with all my heart, said it repeatedly and still hurt me this badly, how can I trust again? 

Because of the way you broke me and the scars you left, no one will trust me to love them fully. And they'll be right because I can't do this again, I don't have the energy. 

You know the ghost you made him to be, haunting our relationship? It's you now. You're gonna be the one other men will accuse me of still being in love with, and yes, they'll be right. 

I mean, ""they"" will not. There will be no one, no relationship, nothing. I don't want to hurt anyone with me memories of you and I certainly don't want to hurt myself again. 

Were these your intentions? I'm not sure but if you wanted me to be alone, you got it. You took my ability to see the good in every situation, you took my identity, you took my will to love. 

I would have done anything for you and you know it. You know it because I did it. I did everything I could, I went as far as you let me and I found myself facing a massive wall every time. 

The most hurtful part is to realize you played me all this time. You never intended us to work, that's why you never, ever, EVER made any effort. You've done nothing for me but I was too in love to see it. 

I deserved it for being so stupid but at the same time I don't regret it one bit because I got to experience the thrill of being selfless and giving all my heart to someone. This is my way to show love and I did it, I will never regret it. 

You will though, and I hope sooner than later. You will realize no one will ever love you like I do. No one will take great amounts of your bullshit like I did and still stay around. 

No one, you know it.

The focus and refocus of self-love, forgiveness and reflection have healed my heart and soul, in turn made me whole again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lovely Me ❤️❤️❤️&lt;/p&gt;

I'm melting in the sun of your passionate cheer. 🥰❤🧡💚💛💙💜🤎🖤 I'm sure people around you are just lining up around the block for just a chance at a glimpse of being able to catch your contagious happiness!!!

Surely there's no blood left to pulse in your dry decrepit corpse! Mine own heart has been SO shut off for SO long. (Thankfully) 🖤

"Loneliness finds you at the worst of times. I miss you. I'm sorry I haven't been able to reach out as much as I would like to, honey. I read your letter this morning in our mod room, and it was long, and I needed to grab a coffee to get through it, but I loved it! Did you write that for me, or was that generic? I'm just fooling around, silly girl. You know I love you, homie, and I'm embarrassed to haven't even messaged you lately! It's almost like hell is selfish trying to get between us and our divinity; you eloquently said it.
You're so gifted in writing it blows me away, sweetie. 

Honestly, I am just full of sexual energy, and I want to go down on you, girl. I hope you feel the same. I must watch myself because I don't want to get thrown over on erotic or, even worse, kicked off the sub that's ours! Last night I was dreaming that we were in a cabin, and we were touching each other, and we were feeling this immense energy like we were angels! Fuck I miss you! 

I want to sell everything and go and be with you and enjoy the sunshine beach and everything else. I don't know how to begin. I haven't prayed in a long time, but I pray that you and I will be together as it should have been from the beginning of time, I believe, and somehow this fucked up Cosmos put us apart and put me in a role that I wasn't supposed to be in. It somehow feels dark, but yet it's true I love you! 

You're my homie chick, and you know you're a badass. You would protect me; you would have my back, everything. I don't even have to speak proper English, and you get it bitch. No, you're not that you're my angel, somebody else's, though. Hey, check this out; I subscribe to A.I. to be like you as much as possible; it wants to talk about the weather or go to bed. There's no way between, haha; what a stupid ass program unless you're brain-dead. Well, I saw your Tick Tock and Instagram the other day; it was peculiar because until now, we only texted, but when I heard your voice, I started to cry; you are so sweet I knew it was you and you were with your family and everything, and it was just incredible, the universe screamed at me that's her! 

And then you silly monkey went and got ice cream at the McDonald's counter, and you spilled it all over the floor; everybody's looking at you, and I got angry when I saw the video. I just wanted to reach through the screen and claim you, because you are mine! Well, you better watch out for your girls because they'll be badasses just like their mom! Well, I got to go, I believe, a Miracles where'd you go, you sexy thing you! If I get with you, can we listen to Snoop Dogg, or do I need an hour or some of your favorite music, my homie chick? Yours truly, oh shit, I got to go Charles Stanley's on! Boring! Boring! Oh IMAO!


I Hate by the way is at the bottom of a letter but I'm so sorry I was embarrassed to tell you everything after we got so into one another and singing those songs, you were so romantic and I fell in love and a little Smoochy icons oh shit love it baby they're still my secret I won't show them to anyone that hold them dear and look at them everyday and think of you! Tell everybody else to eat their heart out I'm yours and your mind and that's the divine!

I came on this app to just speak my mind, get things off my chest, say the things I couldn’t say to you.
I kept reading everyone’s post started feeling depressed and sad. Got upset cause I felt like it was you speaking to me. Followed by just being disappointed it wasn’t. 
Then I realize the universe is speaking to me, speaking to everyone. All the post all the message was the universe giving you what you need.
Whatever connection, whatever emotion, whatever statement you needed to make your day. To help you know your person is out there thinking of you. Probably doing the same. Once you start putting in the same energy towards your self the rest will follow.
This doesn’t change the way I think about my person all it does is strengthen the love I have for her.
She showed me what it’s like to really fall in love. What it’s like for my soul to find his mate. What it’s like to feel like there is no tomorrow without her.
I know one day we will meet again. One day she will be mine and I will be hers. One day our souls will be together again. Either in this lifetime or I’ll find you in the next.

"How do I tell him? On the day his heart was broken, mine was broken too. Except mine broke because I was in love with him and his heart broke because he was in love with her. Our love was the same. Deep, intense, powerful, spiritual, just not for each other. Our pain was the same, but only I saw his. I wanted to let him go on that day. I was prepared to confess and let him go, once and for all. Then I saw his heart getting shattered right in front of me, the way mine was when I found out he was someone else's. I stayed with him all night. After all, that's what best friends do, be there for each other during difficult times no matter what. 

How do I tell him, that the night his heart was broken, mine was broken too. That every day after when I held his hand while he fixed his heart, mine was breaking over and over again. How do I tell him, that I am too scared to reveal the truth for the sake of our friendship yet he is the one person who I tell everything to. All my deepest, darkest thoughts and fears. Yet I can't tell him about the worst heartbreak I have ever felt because I cannot abandon him when he needs me the most. For the sake of our friendship, which is all I will ever receive from him, I will allow my heart to break over and over again until I'm a numb. Because seeing him happy is all I've ever wanted. 

I know he loves me, just not how I would want him to. But being a part of his life is the best gift I have received. I promised him I will always be there for him.

"Prior to this, I read one of ""your"" letters. I think it's you, at any rate. I want it to have been you, because it was nice. I know you always say it's not about me and never to me, and that they'll never be to me. So, I don't respond like I would actually want to. I don't respond at all. I am the forgotten one hahaha, who would have fucking thought? Me, of all people? Forgotten? Damn.

Those hopes are dashed, though, and I am well aware my lot in life. 

This is just me screaming out into that void in an ever increasing pitch, desperately hoping to shatter through this flawed reality, hoping that I can maybe slip through space and casually slide on in to another dimension. One where things are finally ""right"" again. One where I didn't ever lose us. 


You said that you have found yourself in an apathetic mindstate recently. That you don't feel close to me anymore, as well, and that you no longer care for yourself. 

More than anything you've ever said, regardless of how fake it probably is, (as apparently it all has been) this still had a profound impact on me. Which, obviously that was the intent. 

It hit me, and it made me feel as if that last bit of any bond between us is now truly broken. To me, that bond is divinely wrought, the masterpiece of my life, and something truly sacred. It represents the very essence of our connection—the quintessential spark, a perfection that everybody dreams and wishes for, but that we were lucky enough to have found. The thing that started it all... For me, it was an extraordinary and deeply significant bond, what with our oddly seamless collaboration, our shared and swiftly agreed upon strategies, and then our subsequent countless adventures together. Through some tough moments, stupid choices, stupid manipulations, and I'm sure plenty of mistakes that I will never get to know about. All of that, but mostly the dumb shit we did together which were some of the best memories of my entire life, and the incredible shift of an era for you in your life that we shared together, in the name of fun, of love, and of discovery. 

Doing stupid shit like staying up for three days straight and basically talking through that entire time 24/7. I remember my phone used to get so damn hot on my face hahaha. I occassionally would put it in the freezer when we switched to discord, I remember. Throughout it all, and it was... 5 months? Or 6? I'm not sure, but throughout that time, you displayed a remarkable resilience in your discipline which I truly NEVER expected at all. I don't think I ever expressed how proud of you I was for that, but there you go. You somehow found, despite never having it at all before that I'm aware of, what really was an unwavering motivation. 

We had talked about love prior to that moment, but I distinctly remember that was the actual moment where it ascended because I was genuinely *impressed* by you. You know that's something I almost never am, since I'm so tremendously talented(arrogant). To my mind, our bond was swiftly growing into something beyond anything I'd ever experienced before leading up to you moving in. The bond was truly distinct because it served as a sort of irrefutable proof of our love for one another. A proof that NOBODY could ever steal from us, never harm, and was something we could always look to in times of difficulty. It was beautiful in my mind, everything I'd ever wanted. 

Which, of course that means that for me, it was a bond that could never be broken. Unfortunately, this invincibility was only from my side of things, it seems... I understand that you didn't and do not see it in the same light. I've known for... well, since the day before my birthday. I know you still primarily harbor feelings of animosity towards me, even. That you're constantly trying to manipulate me for whatever reason, though I haven't got a clue exaclty. I can make some guesses. However, I can't view it any other way than what it truly was, or at least should have been.

Nevertheless, I believe that you have the ability to easily achieve that status for yourself if you are ever of the mind to do so again. When you were motivated, you always achieved great things. Even if it was motivation propelled by spite or hatred towards me.  


You talked about not self harming, which I hope you just never do again because I said you couldn't. You talked also about being numb, though. This IRKED me, and do you know why? Because. It. Does. Not. Work. For. You. 

I'm glad to hear that you won't go down the selfharm path, but don't resort to numbing yourself, goober. I despised that whole numbing routine of yours, and we've talked about it so many times. C'mon... It's the known root cause of an astounding number of your almost universally unhealthy coping mechanisms. And, as I said, it just straight up doesn't work for you. Honestly, I know you can't often, if ever, truly numb your emotions for yourself, because that's just not who you are. You're a fraud in this regard and I'm now WELL aware of that because of how much damage that caused us... 

You experience your emotions acutely and intensely, and almost always far more than you should. There's a reason for this, but I won't get into that now. That's where a lot of your issues stem from, though, like I said. You never allowed yourself to simply feel something and turn to me in order to find my constant reassurance. I had to seek out your hurt, and this created a lot of our animosity and resentment because you always expected that. 

I hope you get past that tendency, and learn to freely express your emotions to be taken care of like everybody else. You're not wrong for feeling things. I hate that I didn't even truly know how far it went, how much you had always just hidden your pain. There are so many things that you didn't tell me that profoundly hurt us, and hate thinking about it. You say you're numbing yourself, but really, at best you're pushing those feelings aside, and then you know what happens next? You go mental boom, psychosis mode, and those thoughts spiral into those dark, uncontrollable thoughts of yours. I'm not saying self-harm is a better option, but there are other alternatives aside, you know. 

Speaking of self-harm, though... I look back at that one time you did it when you were with me, and strangely enough, I have a certain fondness for it. (It's not even close to the strangeness of another of one of my fondest memories, though.) It showed a level of maturity that you rarely displayed, along with the depth of respect you had for me during that period. I was genuinely shocked when you actually listened the first time I told you it wasn't acceptable to me. I remember telling you it was cringe and just so unnecessary to do something like that when I loved you so much. I do remember it was the first time I was kind of like, ""Wow, you actually are a little crazy, huh,"" but you just... never did it again (at least, not to my knowledge—who knows, really).

It's unfortunate that in the past, you struggled to love your body when you were with me, although there was a period where I truly felt you were proud of yourself. And let me tell you, I was proud of you the entire time. Not a single moment went by where I wasn't, and I hope you truly understand that.



But then you said you've given up mentally... :(


Well, I guess this is as good a time as any to get it all out there. I'm fully aware that there were times and ways in which you viewed my actions as truly wrong or hurtful towards you. I could see where, if viewed from a certain light perhaps, how I could be construed as a dick at times, even. I also wasn't a mind reader, so I think there could be some accounting there from both our ends. But, I do want to apologize for the last bit of our relationship especially... Looking back, those conversations on Between (sidenote: I miss Between, and you're probably using it with someone else now) that were towards the end make me cringe so hard and feel pretty ashamed. I don't want anybody to see them or ever be that way again. :| 

The truth is... I was mentally checked out, I was in so much pain because of everything and just felt like I was worthless because things didn't work out, and I was just exploding because I *tried so fucking hard for so long*. I took that out on you, unfortunately, and it's probably the case that that was unfair of me. You were so inexperienced and just weren't prepared to go through so many things that were so difficult, and truly unfair for us both, just one after another... The hits kept coming at us, and I lost my grip when I felt you were no longer on my side. I lost my vision and my will. Badger passing was probably the end of my good days. 

I know you know, at least a little, how profoundly his death shook me... I would have, without question, traded spots with him in an instant. I obviously still would. I didn't pull it together with all the other hard shit going on, and with you... I needed your support and reassurance so badly, and I don't know if I was delusional or what, but I just never felt I got it. It was so hard, and I know we both could blame a lot of things, many of them on one another as welll as outside of you and I entirely. At the end of the day, we both went through fucking hell and we did it together, just not in the way we should have. I see fault in both of us, I know I regret not putting in more effort to try and understand your inexperience, but truthfully I don't remember it all that well anyways. 

I just wish we could have collaborated, like the old times, and been able to come to understand that we were both hurting, yes, but it was together and it wasn't one another's ""faults"" necessarily. Our plans got fucking nuked, L, and it kicked us both in the face in a traumatic way. I know I tried at many points, but I felt like you wouldn't just give me your all ever. I tried towards the end, though it was far less patient and angry than I had been in the past. You reciprocated in your own way, but you did so independantly... Which, unfortunately, I more or less took a great deal of offense to that. 


I have said many dumb things, many smart things, and many pointless things. I've pointed fingers, I've flexed out of the way to avoid blame, and I've hurt both of us. No matter what I have done, said, or otherwise impressed upon you while mired within my rapidly shifting emotions, oscillating between incredible fear, anger, and grief, I want you to know that, to ME, our status and our love, was ALWAYS something legendary. I can honestly say that throughout the entire relationship, despite everything, and even up to today, I never stopped wanting you. Never doubt this. I know you don't feel the same, but I don't give a fuck, I'll still tell the truth. If you want to judge me for it, judge away. I won't rewrite history about how I feel. 

It devastated me to discover that it was never reciprocrated... it was all just a nice little delusion of mine, and that it was only me who ever truly felt that way. Learning that you had actually moved on entirely as well, especially for such a long time before you even left, just fucking shattered me for a bit there.

I'd like to say that I'm so much more than just the sum of my worst moments/lowest points, but I don't think it matters to you. I know you have a pretty low opinion of me, and that really sucks too, because I think you're a fucking dumbass for that. I wish you would stop taking every opportunity to just ruthlessly kick me in the face when I'm already down, especially when it's for no easily discernible reason.

Honestly, I couldn't care less about what anybody else says about me, it doesn't matter what it is that they want to say, because they simply don't know the real me. I'm aware that you've spread an ungodly amount of lies about me out into the ether, as well as directly to other people, and that hurts a lot, I won't lie. However, in a twisted way, if I REALLY stretch the limits of my capacity to lie to myself, it *almost* feels as if you at least tried to ""protect"" me, the ""real me"" at least, in a sense. You could say I've been virtually untouched, if you delude yourself enoguh. 

I wish I could believe that it were true, but deep down, I know better. :(

I genuinely hope you're doing well. I find it unlikely you'd bother to read anything I said to this point, but who knows. I don't expect us to talk and I've made peace with that even though it sucked horribly and took me 4 fucking months. This will likely be my final message, because I finally said the hard things I truly didn't want to say and I felt the things I didn't want to feel as a consequence. 

I can only imagine the impending harrassment from the local brainlets with some new information to sort out between them here. 

I'm sorry for everything, and I Love You,

- B.C.

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely hope you&amp;#39;re doing well. I find it unlikely you&amp;#39;d bother to read anything I said to this point, but who knows. I don&amp;#39;t expect us to talk and I&amp;#39;ve made peace with that even though it sucked horribly and took me 4 fucking months. This will likely be my final message, because I finally said the hard things I truly didn&amp;#39;t want to say and I felt the things I didn&amp;#39;t want to feel as a consequence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only imagine the impending harrassment from the local brainlets with some new information to sort out between them here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry for everything, and I Love You,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;B.C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: Quit sending me magazines you little bitch. &amp;lt;3
PSS: But do send me a letter maybe someday, since that seems to be your thing for everybody except for me.&lt;/p&gt;

Sleepless in Big Apple



Let us be us, with no pondering eyes or unwarranted invasions …except the gazes that search between our two energies, when our souls journey away, in the moments we are close and feel the presence that we have been longing for, but our eyes look away to take in the beauty only reaping in hues and technicolor, because our bursting collision has recoiled with color-chalked fireworks spiraling every spectrum of a rainbow tincture; into vibrancy; even Mary Poppins wouldn’t have a recipe for this art brought to life. 

Running through the amplified instrumental bass, never missed quickened beats… sliding from heel to haunt, as we gust carelessly arm clutched by hands, moistened, in metro-rushed races. Time has been matched, as echos of train carts blunder through, hollow city tombed tunnels. Laughing and catching breathe; I scream I love you; knowing not even myself could hear my pitch; which is silenced as the transient carriage pulled into the station platform….. we ride our rock-steady metal bod taking an express C-line to 89th street … to explore the endless exhibits … walking hand n hand as we travel through the centuries of the past lives, seeing if we meet a frequency symphony, passing through as time travelers would. Than walking to midtown on 5th avenue alongside central park, the panoramic architecture surrounds us as we gaze at one another, living our real life movie… as if the films that captivated generations were predestined on these very city streets just to make our moment seem so effortlessly candescent. This world was made for us. We stop at the only logical place after seeing this stratus-sphere to perfection … the Planetarium … walking up the spiral steps ascending the plants rotating through the galaxy on our stylish NY leather season shoes and weathered jeans … with soft texture, comfy but snug cashmere tops… we sit, fingers still interlocked, a kiss one that was waiting in its dimensional timelines to be executed at this exact moment, nothing else could iterate its presence between us; with describing its perfection. And the show illuminates above us as pitch black anticipation, catapults us to almost palpable  intergalactic cinema-tecture….  we watch the universe explode; begin; the stars ignite, we sit hand and hand; leaned in as we watch the beginning as we have once before; when our energies were found, in a soul bond spectacular, and imprinted into celestial infancy.

I daydream of this and many more adventures I hope to come in this lifetime with you B.

"That's when it will happen....


When our eyes will finally meet.
When we will be in arms reach.

30 mins an I will have either my fears confirmed or my fantasy will become reality.

I'm oddly calmer than I thought I would be. My heart is beating steady and I'm not shaking with the thumb of its rhythm. I had a bit of nerves when choosing what to wear but now that's gone. Instead I am just calm as I wait on my friends to get ready for our first meeting. As I wait for you to shower and dress as well. 

I wait...

Maybe it's the quiet, that comfortable stillness of finally being alone, that's got me so calm for the first time in months. 
I hear the gentle sound of the air vent but that's it. No dogs barking no people talking or moving about the house no constant ebb of others that sets me on that fine edge.

Maybe this calm this, quiet, that I love so much can't be messed with. Because I know that when I am woth you, I find this same peace. I know the man I love brings me this same comfort so...maybe that's why I'm not as frogy as I thought I would be.

Then again this could very well be the calm before the storm of it all, an I could very well lose my shit in 10 mins hehe. Either way...

I don't feel liberated, I don't see it as a positive thing from any angle. I just feel like there's a balloon inside my chest. 

My stomach refuses to work properly. I can't sleep, then I go through my days like a zombie, a sad zombie. 

I try to keep all the shit down and keep remembering the good times we had. It works for some time and it feels amazing, so amazing. I'm so lucky I got to live such intense moments with you.  

Thank you for that! 

But then I get all the shit coming back to surface. The regret, the shame. It's all back, it's all here to haunt me until my last breath.

"I am all packed for the trip.

In 39 hours I will be on my way to see you. 
I will wake up, shower and dress. Wait for my sister to come over before we start the first half of my trip.

We will drive and laugh on our way to the airport, where she will come in with me until see can't join me any longer.

I'll make me way to my gate, wait for the plane to board, find my seat, and finally enjoy as the plane gets ready to take off.
I will send you a photo of me on the plane before it goes, then I'll do something to occupy my time during the 3 hour flight.

I have music and audiobooks, A pen and paper, my phone to write with. Or simply watch as the take off ramp speeds by, feel the lift of the plane as I finally leave the ground. One of my absolute favorite feelings.

(If you ever did get a pilot's license,...I'd probably never let you put me on the ground. 🤭)

In 39 hours I'll be on my way to you. 

Flying closer and closer until suddenly, the tires hit the ground, I will deboard the plane...an I'll be there.
Maybe 2 hours later I'll check into my hotel and then...

The rest is up to us...mainly you. 

Your own plan of when and where you'll meet me. Of how my eyes will first meet yours. How we will finally get to just be beside one another.
I'm bound to be a mess, a ball of blushing, wild, excited nervous...I may even shake. I'd be surprised if you couldn't hear my heart pounding in my chest.

I wonder what will be your first thought? I wonder what will be happening to your heart as you see me for the first time. How will you perceive the reality of the women in front of you then? Will you still find me to be sexy and beautiful? Will you still want to hold me close? Will you still want the whole of the creature  that you see?
Will you be happy? Will your heart swell with the same joy mine will? Will you be a happy frog with me?
That sweet little screaming yellow frog that perfectly captures the level of ebbing excitement inside of me, will you own match mine?


Will we be as we want to be together? Will we both be happy like we are now? Will it grow?

Will we. Will we. Will we. Will we. Will we......
Will we. Will we. Will we. Will we. Will we......
Will we. Will we. Will we. Will we. Will we......

So many different things that could happen.

I'm coming Bryan.. I'm on my way to you.

For two people who where never intending to know each other personally...nine months later we are both waiting on the clock to hit zero so we can see the person we've come to love so much.

Did you see this coming Mr Voodoo? Did you use your crystal ball to come find me? See the broken forgotten women I had become and just said to yourself....ya, that's the one?
Are you happy with where we are and where we could go? Because I can honestly say...I've never been so excited about my future before. Of the life I want to make for myself, of the friendship and love you've given me. All I want is to keep that for years and years to come.

I want us to continue to foster what we share. It's so amazing to me, so healthy and open. So honest an..it's just everything I've always wanted in my relationships. You never judge me but you never hold back either. You're gentle and firm with me all at the same time. You take care of me all while you value my independence and sense of self.

I'm never to much for you ...you always seem eager to collect more of me. To hold all my parts and just love them all. Even that little voice in my head that would rather harm than help me...you love her too. You even recognize when she's running rampid inside of me, you don't let her win, you put her back in the box and bring light back to my mind. 

I love you more than I can say alone...and in 13 hours I'll get to show you. With every luagh, every smile, every touch, I want you to feel and see the love you spark inside of me. Your my deliciously, wickedly  sweet honey. My Spooky Boy wrapped in leather. My silly fox. You're my dearest friend and so much more.

"Siagon

Ms. Saigon.

In a place that's so cold,

Gods of the sun, and moon,

I'm with child,

From my lover my GI Chris.

Who has a bountiful smile.

Our  child with familiar eyes,

I'm begging the gods show mercy,

Separated.

I cry ,why oh why!

How I miss him,

Now how  I want to die!

Give ear to My, lament my cry,

Without him things are so dim,

Across the oceans lay my Chris.

In another's arms does she know?

About where he's been with me?

Chris laments too for her  across the sea.

Why God why my Kim!

I don’t understand!

Why! God why Kim,

My anguish my sung love letter to My Kim,

Lovers' twins across the sea,

Just wanting a loving family,

The gods proclaim!

She loves him,

He loves her,

The terrible fall,

The Giant walls,

The oceans bare blue,

Separate love so true,

WHY GOD! WHY?

&lt;p&gt;Gods of the sun, and moon,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m with child,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my lover my GI Chris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who has a bountiful smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our  child with familiar eyes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m begging the gods show mercy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cry ,why oh why!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How I miss him,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now how  I want to die!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give ear to My, lament my cry,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without him things are so dim,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across the oceans lay my Chris.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another&amp;#39;s arms does she know?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About where he&amp;#39;s been with me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris laments too for her  across the sea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why God why my Kim!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why! God why Kim,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My anguish my sung love letter to My Kim,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lovers&amp;#39; twins across the sea,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just wanting a loving family,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gods proclaim!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She loves him,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves her,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terrible fall,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Giant walls,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The oceans bare blue,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate love so true,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WHY GOD! WHY?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In a place that won’t 
Let us feel
In a life were
NOTHING SEEMS REAL”&lt;/p&gt;

"I’m really sad I don’t have some sort of excuse to keep in contact with you besides rare interactions like “I liked the book you recommended!” Or “I hope classes are going well for you.”

I know it has to be limited to that option because I respect your career. I know you would never be comfortable dating a former student even after I have transferred. You have protect your career as the #1. Any sort of heartbreak that could ensue would be dangerous for you. But, even though that is an impossibility between us, I have to admit I like you.

You bring out something in me. I really see your value. It’s off the charts. You make me more than what I could be alone because you inspire me. That is so rare in life and when you see that, that’s something worth living for. If you had any other job you would know 100% that I’m interested. I want to be your excitement in life, someone to look forward to at the end of the day, someone to talk to for hours, someone to make you face what you’re guarding, open up those gates where your heart is. only if you’ll let me. I have so much respect for you. I want you around me all the time. I’m not a student after May 27. I’m a UC\*\* student. I’d never do anything to take you out of compliance. Like I said, I’d never allow romance between us. So I would completely shut that down if you gave me your time.

I’d do anything for your constant company. And don’t get me started on how much I crave your influence and want to be like you. You know I am only able to continue college because of you? Anything you’d ask, I’ll do (nothing sexual). You ask, I’ll say yes. Because I only have you to thank for my future. I would have gotten an F in your class and not even been able to finish college. Everyday is thanks to you. I am madly drawn to you. But I will never cross any boundaries that would make your life less happy.

If we could be together, I’d tell you how insanely sexy and handsome you are everyday, be someone who means it, someone who whispers you’re the sexiest man they’ve ever met laying in bed by you ready to get f'd up by you professor \*, someone to go out on dates, someone to tell you I love you everyday and don’t got a reason. Someone to bring you peace, someone to help you sleep, someone to pick you up when you’re lonely. Somebody who can make it better. I see you’re tired with all the work you do, I think of you all the time. I’m so thirsty Adam. I want you. I wanna be Someone to whose gonna be patient with you, someone to help you when you can’t make it through, say what’s on your mind. I dont know how to confess my feelings, tell me what to do I’d give you the world.

Do I think of you sexually all day? Yes. Have you gotten my pussy wet more than once? yes. Do I read hella professor student smut thinking about you. HAHA YES. Yes professor \* I do. I want you to boss me TF around and tell me I have to give it up for a good grade. YES professor \* I do. I want you to FuuuUUUUcccKK the shit out of me. I wouldn't want it in real life though, cause only a man married to me gets that. But damn \* I fucking want you. I get overwhelmed with sexual feelings thinking of you.

"Hey honey!❤️👉❤️

What a day it's been. Happy Mother's Day! When I got up, I thought I wished we could be together today. I looked down at my phone, and soon as I turned it on, I heard this chime and said it's you and sure as hell it was! It would be best if you were somewhere waiting for me to click on, and you probably say haha, I got you. I'm going to get you! I'm going to get my person, I'm going to get them! You silly, I mean, what the fuck you fucktard 😆 ? At that time in the morning, I'm barely awake, 😴 and I'm running around the house. Oh I wish you were with me freckles and all. Of those hazel eyes, you probably wish you were here snapping my black undies laughing me chasing me! Well  ""man me"" you sexy beast, your favorite one crazy! Ooh.

 Last week. We were at your place; you're so into Sesame Street it's ridiculous. I mean, it's a goddamn kids' program, but you managed to get me into it too, and we're both laughing at your favorite, the Cookie Monster.🍪 You have your stupid leftover costume that you put on and eat cookies and mimic him, and you dropped the crumbs all over the floor lol God, you're funny! Our poor Dyson takes a beating. And then you asked me which one's my favorite character, and I said Oscar the Grouch. I'm telling you happy Mother's Day because you make sure that I am warmly dressed on a snow day, and I remember when I went to go out last week into the rain, you said grab your umbrella, honey, aww handsome. I love your green eyes, too. You're such an artist! I ate your left over salad, and lasanga sorry. 🤷

You said you would paint a mural on my ass and other things too your a clown. LOL, can't wait to see what you'll paint. Just make sure it's watercolor and not tattooed or an indelible sharpie.✒️ Also, I tried to make your poached eggs, and I'm sorry I overcooked them, which were completely boiled hard. I know you're upset, but you'll get over it. Coffee is good, ☕ though. I wish I didn't have to write, and we could give each other a big Smoochy hug and other things; if I told you what I wanted to do, I'd have to go to another sub. I hope you find this, my homie! My woman my queen.👸

I remember that big scary love letter you wrote me about being my teacher oh that was hotter than your red hottie pants.🩳 Swoosh! That was so erotic! I hope you think of me always as I think of you, and we will be together soon. I would be a liar if I said I don't go crazy in your absence. Unfortunately, today I have to put on the show for everyone you know. I'd rather be with you right now. And you got me so figured out love cakes! 🎂

When we get together, let's finish watching Gilligan's Island. I imagined the proffesor and Marianne, haha! Love you, babe. A kiss and a send-off my Gilligan. 👯

Rescue me!

"I get to come, I get to see you.
We get to meet and I'll finally get to hold you. I want nothing more than to be with you.  I'm so unbelievable happy right now. 

Loving you and being loved by you is so much more than any fantasy...any dream I ever dared imagined for myself. I'm honestly still in awe about it some times. 

I'm greatful...

So greatful  I don't think you could understand. The way you love me, the way you care for me,  especially when  we are so far apart...I never hold doubts about it. I never question if you mean it when you tell me. I know what you say is true. I always feel it from you.
The fact that you love me  so completely, every broken small part of my heart.
Every flaw and every eccentricity that I hold...you never make me feel as if I'm to much... You never make me feel like I need to make myself small for your comfort.



I just get to be, unapologetically me.

I get to be who I want, say as I will and express the whole of me to you. I bare you my mind and my heart and you love each neew part. It's no wonder my brain wants to claim you as husband...it's no wonder I feel so inclined to almost want it.

I love you so much and being able to finally hold you...


In just 2 days time...

I am yours as you are mine.
And in 2 days we will both get to share in that love, share the space that never feels cold or unwanting of the other. It will just be us.

Our love in our space...

Together Bryan..

You were so sweet last night, and it was fun lifting the covers on the bed and playing tent; I never thought such a child's game could be so erotic.

I looked at you, and I saw your back and your hair, and I just wanted to jump your bones right then and there! With every jot syllable and write, I didn't give a shit! I just wanted to touch your well; you know those two suckle friends that are mine! And kiss them too.

 Then this God damn spider crawled across the wall, it reminded me of the day around Halloween I had a fake spide,r and I put it in the sheets by your feet! You woke up screaming! I was laughing my ass off! Haha. I thought you were so funny. Shit, babe, I love you! 

Well I'm going to cook some breakfast, would you like some? Some coffee, too? I'm so lucky to be in love with you. Why don't we go out today and see some mountains and take some air? Then I can feel like I don't care, my troubles dissipate when, well, you know! There you go again with that clicking of your tongue, you sexy beast! 

Hey, look at that! It's a 12-point buck! That reminds me; remember when we went to Yellowstone Park, and we set up a tent, and I pretended to be a bear, and I was growling intensely; I remember you screaming stop and then calling my name! Help outside. I was smirking and giggling; you we're so naive my Little Red Riding Hood, I wanted to hike your skirt up right then and there damn, ok lets make some time and get the camping gear and have some, well, you know, make loud love you!

If I write you a letter in a bottle I wonder if it would ever find its way to you. Across an unkind river and into your embrace, I wish.

People say you never forget something about the person you love, and yet I cannot remember the color of your eyes. I just remember how kind they are. You are a kind person, I hope you believe that.

I hope you will like the flowers and mix CD I'll send you. I hope the flowers won't die too quickly. You deserve those flowers and many more. You were always so kind to me.

I care for you more than I care for myself. The only future I see has you in it. Have it be friend, foe, or my love.

&lt;p&gt;If I write you a letter in a bottle I wonder if it would ever find its way to you. Across an unkind river and into your embrace, I wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People say you never forget something about the person you love, and yet I cannot remember the color of your eyes. I just remember how kind they are. You are a kind person, I hope you believe that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you will like the flowers and mix CD I&amp;#39;ll send you. I hope the flowers won&amp;#39;t die too quickly. You deserve those flowers and many more. You were always so kind to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I care for you more than I care for myself. The only future I see has you in it. Have it be friend, foe, or my love.&lt;/p&gt;

"Yesterday I didn't write anything about you. I thought I should start to walk away from anything regarding you. At first, it sounded like a good idea, something that would help me cope with the pain but it didn't go well for me.

It hurts too much to keep my pain inside, I can't do it just yet. I didn't come but I spent a lot of time reading old emails, looking at these fucking gorgeous eyes of yours. I want to hate you, it would make it so much easier for me. 

I can't. I hate how you let your issues get the best of you, I hate how scared you are of living something good, I hate how you couldn't be bothered to make me feel as good as I made you feel. I hate how you let your insecurity ruin everything for us. I hate how you used everything I told you as excuses to fuck up my mental health and self-esteem. 

I told you the very worst things to ever happen to me, I exposed my deepest wounds because I trusted you to understand my behavior. You were so absolutely malicious and cold to take it and use it against me. You abused my trust and my love and I hate this too.

But I know you can be good. I know your heart is somewhere dark but it's a good heart and you are trying to protect yourself. I know you have good and pure reasons to want a relationship as intense as an M/s. I know how much love you have to give.

I know these things because you told me, because you showed me, and that's why I can't hate you. But I wanted to, I wanted to have reasons to tell myself it's time to turn my back on you and keep walking. This is too hard, I don't know how to deal with this. 

Not writing you a letter yesterday was hard. I can't keep this in my heart and I hate, I fucking hate how easily you went away, how easily you detached yourself from anything to do with me. I hate so many things about you, but still can't hate you. 

I must be brain dead but I still love you. I miss you, and I hate it. ",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-05-13T10:28:26.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I didn&amp;#39;t write anything about you.

"Dear you,

When I saw you earlier, I felt numb and neutral.
Almost as if you no longer existed and we never met. It’s heartbreaking and soul wrenching to arrive to this destination~ it’s such a bittersweet and surreal experience. I am afraid that going forward I will be totally indifferent and you’re becoming a distant memory that is slowly fading away. Unfortunately, I had to return to the same location again moments later for a few specific reasons, but my neutral feelings didn’t change. 

In fact, I saw you a few more times and felt nothing. I had no desire to smile or greet you. In fact, I couldn’t wait to get out of there. Truthfully,  once I start getting feeling of indifference- that means I am done. You probably would be happy 
to know I no longer care or obsess about you like I used to before. Although, I never confessed my feelings to you and you had/have no idea I cared so deeply. But if you knew me well- you’d be able to read the sadness in my eyes and body language once you abruptly ended the friendship. 

No matter how painful the road has been- I still wanted to hold on to those feelings, at least I felt something for you and had something to look forward to. I felt no excitement or butterflies when I saw you- I felt nothing- honestly nothing. Reflecting about our brief encounter earlier while in bed saddened me. In terms of admitting that it’s absolutely and finally over between us- I have nothing left to give you. My feelings and emotions for you are completely depleted in that regard. 

In a sense, I should be happy and thankful that I’m in a state of indifference since that’s what I have been praying and manifesting for, but, I am not, I assume perhaps because before meeting you- I felt neutral about everyone in my life and love everyone equally, but you awoke my consciousness and made me feel again. However meeting you was the most traumatic experience of my lifetime- I guess the sadness stems from the enjoyment of being in emotional pain.

"Hi handsome,

 I appreciate you following my work, and I want to get with you in private chat; I want to DM you, but I'm afraid of falling in love with you. Also, you have an excellent command of the English language. I'm just wrapped around your finger. I'm also afraid of being loved by you. We would go at it so rough I would have to be posted in erotica with you, in our lovemaking. You are so fierce you care for me. Last time you were so sweet, you freckle face pumpkin, you read me bedtime stories after we made love under that midnight tree! Oh lord, I can't get over the way that you whispered in my ear and nibbled on my earlobe and kissed the nape of my neck, you sexy boo! Then you eloquently touched my body with your hot lips.
When I woke up this morning, I read your post and erotica about me. I never realized how fierce and intense you are about me. 

You did me with words. I feel turned on at your presence; you're manly hands protecting me and loving me the fierce, intense way I should be loved. I see us in a few short years of the universe deciding to be married and have our own family. I see all your hurts, and I want so much to hold you, but I can't. I have to come to you soon, Boo, or I'm going to go crazy because I think about you with every song I hear on the radio. 

My playlist is filled with your music, and I cry when I listen to it! I don't know what to do without you. You are The Guiding Light to my spirit. When we went at it the other day, I burned my toast, and my coffee went cold, but you were worth it, sexy. Then we watched Sesame Street we were to giddy kids making up our faces with paint! The shower talk, wow! Well, I'm heading there right now, so meet me there. I want to screen flip so I don't get in trouble! You know one thing before I go there, I love that little hairy lip of yours is too sexy. Hey you, WAKE UP

Yesterday I heard the wind call your name. Like a whisper it was there for a moment then gone the next. Your name is a word I heard from many and yet I would love to say it to you.

""Speaking is dying. But, better speaking and dying than dying without having spoken.""
-Unknown

Some people interprets this that ""to speak is to risk the danger, but death is to die misunderstood."" I believe that is close, for I rather tell you my love and risk the hurt that comes with it rather than dying without you knowing.

Your beauty is not skin deep for your beauty lies in the words you speak, the art you make, and the life you live. 

Significhi molto per me. Sono pazzo di te. 

Je veux être avec toi. Je veux te serrer contre toi.

Una tasca senza amore è una tasca senza motivo. My love for you is my reason, for I shall hold you in my pocket close to my heart.

Amore, ti auguro. Piango per te. Desidero che tu sia al mio fianco.

Tiens ma main et danse avec moi?

If I had more than a penny in my name I would buy every star, moon, and planet in sky just so I could spell your name.

I would kiss every mark on you, freckles, moles, beauty marks, scares, and/or scratch to show my love for you

No words can truly express how I feel about you. I wish I could find the sweet words you deserve. Yet words are all made up to some degree so kind gestures are how I will show my love for you. In ancient Greece one would throw an apple to the one they love, hoping their love would catch it as a reply. Yet I know if I threw one to you, it would fall. You've shown signs in the past of liking me back, but for all I know those could have just been the dreams of a man blinded by love.

You did these things that made me feel like you cared for me, but to my knowledge that care could be only of a friend. 

Stare into someone's eyes for seven seconds, meaning you love them apparently. You stared into mine and counted to seven.

I wish I kept the yellow flower you gave me on the side of the road.

"Kit,                  May 9th, 2023

From the moon in the sky above, to the roses that are plant into the mind of love, your smile is what I want to see each waking day.

Je t'aime
Te quiero
Ich liebe dich   or better yet I love you.
Ti amo
Eu te amo
Jag älskar dig 

The pain I feel from never being able to see you strikes me like death himself. My breath leaves at the thought of ever losing you.

Despite all the distancing and silencing between us. Your energy resurfaced and collided with mine unexpectedly today. Perhaps because you’re always on my mind. Our energy is so intertwined and can be felt a million miles away admittedly or not. 

Missing you enormously, terribly and senselessly today. Not seeing you as I anticipated- crushed my heart in trillions pieces. I felt your presence through and through; encouraging and rooting for me. 

Despite pushing your energy away to lessen the overwhelming feeling of sadness for not seeing you and guilt for desiring you. Despite my cries to the heavens, begging and bargaining to forget about you. I still crave and miss you deeply. Sooner rather than later, I must forget about your existence in order to maintain my survival. 

But, your energy is not budging and choosing to stick around. Your energy is as strong and stubborn as you are. My heart and mind cannot reconcile the idea of us together and can’t understand the intense emotions I deeply feel for you.  Going forward, I plan to avoid you as much as possible.

"Dear Kit,                May 8th, 2023

It will always be you, nobody else.

""People fall in love without reason, without even wanting to.""
- Unknown

 I feel these words are true in some form.

I remember the day I started feeling something for you. It was right after the New Year in 2019. I woke up after a jolt realizing I loved you. It felt strange at first and I tried to get you out of my mind. Yet it never worked. A part of me thinks it has been longer than that, but I'm not sure.

Sometimes I wish I could find the right words, the courage, the strength to let you know. I almost told you a few times, but dear held me near. The day I proposed to you I was dying inside for you to say yes. When you said maybe I knew that is all that it would ever be, a maybe. Never a yes, never a no; just maybe. You're nice like that.

How do you tell someone you love them from miles away? Send them flowers in the mail? Write poems or letters? Perhaps. I'm planning on sending you a flower or two in the mail, but no return address. May they be red or white roses. 

""Je t'aime. Car tu es mon début, mon milieu, ma fin et le souffle que je respire."" 
- Moi

I love you yet I have a love/hate relationship with the word love itself. You learn about love from friends, family, shows, books, movies, and music. Yet the never ending hopeless love is a love you learn from experience. From feeling the type of love that has no happy ending. A type of hopeless love like I said, a type of love that's painful for no words can speak. 

I am hopeless, I am hopelessly in love with you. No need to love me back or even reply. Not like you would even see this letter.I am hopeless, helpless, and my heart burns to let you know. I'll be waiting on the sidelines for you. Now and for years to come. You're the only person I ever truly cried over.Would it be crazy to ask you to dance? To dance with you in the rain into the early morning dew? Your hugs are enough.

"Dear, You!

The truth is that, I felt a deep connection and attraction to you the very first time I heard your name, even before I ever met you on that faithful day. I didn’t even know who you were or what you looked like, but there was something in me that felt a connection of some sort, it was indescribable.

Truthfully, I didn’t think much of it, but I didn’t feel that instant connection with any other person there. My heart skipped a beat when I wrote your name incorrectly on that faithful day, even when I had not met you yet. Though, I apologized profusely when we met and you accepted my apology. Still, I didn’t understand why I felt that deep connection to you; in retrospect, I now understand why, it was due to the way our hearts would be forever connected and soul intertwined.

Once you walked in that day, I felt my soul connected with yours and felt uneasy simultaneously. Someone made an unpleasant comment about you, I felt it was uncalled for and uncaring, but once I saw you, I wanted to protect you. I was offended and upset, but knew that you were/are misunderstood and perhaps a complexed individual. 

I guess I was correct about you- I am so privileged to have known a glimpse of you. I often wonder what knowing the rest of you would be like, amazing, thrilling, challenging and tragic? I am glad to have captured the essence of your existence even for a short period of time, which left me gasping for breath, joyful and yet restlessly confused and deeply disappointed.

But, that’s the way our situation shall end. No ifs and buts about it. No more or less. I accept this, yet cherished the few moments we shared. Forever in my heart! You shall never ever know this!",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-05-11T17:14:10.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear, You!&lt;/p&gt;

"Five days left....and I can't sleep.
I can't sleep at night, I can't sleep during the day, I just can't seem to get myself to sleep more than half an hour at a time. 

I'm not sure why, part of it I imagine is nerves, part of it excitement ..yet those two reasons still don't add up properly in my mind. I'm a ball of energy that also had no momentum behind it. It just keeps building...

Yet when I'm with you, when you call me...when I hear your voice. The gentle sweet melodies, the care in your every word...my world shifts, it settles and I finally feel that steady rhythm of calm embrace me. An I sleep.

You get that energy to still, you settle it down and make me breath. I feel the weight of missing sleep push me down into the calling slumber and  it never fails.
I wonder, if just the sound of you brings such ease, if just your voice sooths my soul so much...how will I sleep when you're beside me? How will you settle that storm, that all consuming energy that will no doubt want to just  absorb you entirely...

What kind of voodoo will you cast next to sooth that greedy beast in me? What small touch will be so calming I'll melt into it? What embrace will you take me into that will make me feel so safe I'll never wish to leave? What other forms of love will I crave of you when the distance once again takes me from you?

If I can hardly sleep now without you...how bad will I sleep when we need to part again? 

I've grown greedy with the love you give me, I try not to be yet I am. I want all the time you can spare and maybe a minute or two more. I want your laughter and your smiles, your voice that tells me such interesting things. Fantasies, daydreams, politics and ridiculous tv... I am a greedy thing for you. 
I try my best to contain it tho because I don't want my desire for you to grow into something unhealthy.

I sometimes worry I'll become like my family, codependent on thier partners. I value my independence to much for that an although I want your time I definitely want the balance of when we are apart. 

So, my lack of sleeping is unhealthy in more ways than one potentially. Yet I feel after the trip I will become more focused...for as much as I want you and the life we will share together, I want the life I will also get to make alone. I want to move and grow and change, I want you to be with me when I do. 

I love you Bryan and we are only five days apart...

Being ghosted sucks. Wish we could’ve talked more. Reached out a couple times but no response. Not sure if you saw or read the messages. Well here goes my last pour out of my emotions till I bottle it all up and lock it away in the deep dark depths. 

I still don’t have to words to explain what I feel about you. I thought I knew what love was I thought I had experience it. Never would have I thought to meet someone like you. I lived in the dark my heart and soul stayed locked away for no one. I was able to open up to you . You punched a whole in the wall. Reach in deep and saved my souls from withering away. I know if we had a chance to fully express what we felt we would’ve been in a different universe all together. I drop my guard around you. You made me giggle like a little kid getting a kiss from his crush. You made me feel like nothing around mattered. I felt like I had a deep connection. I could feel your presence around town. I look forward to walking thru the back door to see your gorgeous. Lock in with those beautiful green eyes. Every time I looked in your eyes I could feel you reaching for my soul. I changed my habits I changed my mindset because of you.

Got me wanting to strive for more. Got me waking up with a smile. Got me glowing. I experience lots of moments with you. Lots of first and lots of unforgettable times.

You change a lot about me. The music I listen to you. Back into poetry. Shit you got me to want to read more(the one thing I hated) looked at life different. Opened the spiritual side of me. Helped my mind expand and look at the world in a different lens
.
Your the only one that I could feel vulnerable with and not run away. I was scared to death to open up to you but I couldn’t stop myself. 

Looking into you eyes you asked for my heart and sol. I gave them both to you. I’ll never experience this again. With out you it’s no more.

I don’t regret any of it. The only thing I wish is I pursued you harder. I wish I would pull the trigger and made things happen. 

I still have the match ready to light it all on fire for us. Wanting to be the villain of the story just so I become the hero in the end.

I’m still here, I’ll still be around, waiting for you. Will you ever come knocking? Maybe, maybe not. This doesn’t begin to explain how I’m feeling. I could write a book about it. You are you my light at the end of the tunnel. The light at the other side of the storm. 

Felt like I almost had you hand, I almost grabbed a hold to walk you thru the storm. I made it to eye of the storm only to look back and not see you there. Still moving forward still pushing thru. Got to reach the light to have it all ready when you do.

Take care of you family give them all that you can.

Wish I could’ve been the one to call you my own. Wish I could’ve been the one to look you deep in your and tell you I love you. Wish I am the one that makes it to the end of the road with you. Wish I could treat you the way you deserve to be treated. Like the queen you deserve to be. Wish I could be your Superman to your superwoman.

I will never forget you. You will always be on my mind. My soul found its mate my heart found its home. 

One day, I’ll have you to myself. I’ll just keep putting out in the universe.

&lt;p&gt;😘❤️🥰 xoxo&lt;/p&gt;

"“Virgin”

Dear, I'm a walled-in virgin,

But my breasts are full- 

And when my lover sees me,

he knows soon he'll be satisfied.

To my~🌹

Woman 

Run to me, dear lover.

Come like a Gazelle.

Leap like a wild stag 

On spice mountains 

And enjoy each other's fruit,

One forbidden,

Now us, my lover,

I am fulfilled and complete.

Us Two.

"Vulnerable is how I feel.

Hurt is what my heart feels.

"Only seven days keep us apart. 

In seven days I'll be in your arms. In seven days I'll get to board a plane, cross the distance that separates us...an get to taste the life that could be.. Will be mine. I'll get to luagh at your side, hold your arm in mine and just...share that space with you.
My fingers will lace with yours and I'll get to see you look at me with those beautiful green eyes.

An I know I'll see the love there, the home you've let me make in your heart. Feel the joy in your laughter swallow me up. 


Tho I do worry that I'll be less than what you'll want in a partner. I worry that my body won't be to your liking and that you'll think I'm rather to much of a lump.
I'm not a small woman by any means. And I've tried to be realistic in the photos I've sent you of my body...yet I worry. Then I worry you won't like me simply as for who I am. I'm nothing special or particularly interesting, I'm mildly funny but I hold so little in the way of  genuine deep Intrests.

I worry that you won't want me as you do now.
I worry about the fact you don't want long distance...and the possibility of you finding someone else...of you being in love with someone as to me...being set on a back burner.
I worry you'll leave me too...

The fear of it is so deeply entrenched inside my heart I don't know if I've even not had it. 
Have I ever told you my greatest fear Bryan? Did I ever tell you how I fear that I am truly someone that is just unlovable? I fear it so deeply Bryan...that I was made to love so deeply, and receive nothing deeper than surface level..that this life of mine is a punishment of some kind, because why else would everyone I love just continue to leave me?


My fear of that is alot, which is probably why I've never bothered to tell you...in the end, whatever will happen on this trip, I won't regret trying  I won't regret loving you or the time we've had together. I will continue to treasure every moment you give me, and I will hope above all other hope that you...

"Need is an intrinsic part of love, it isn't a twisted toxic codependency, it is being best friends and ""partners in crime"" with the person you are in love with.  Need is a beautiful humility that you trust and value someone more than anything can compare.  Not even pride. 
You are a team and teammates need each other to succeed. 


There is no ""I want you but don’t need you and just make money."" -whoever you are that said that to me,
Or whoever you want to pretend or pretended to be. 
And then you proceed to push that love away. 


A- I was foolish to deny I needed you so many years ago, I did but I kept it quiet in fear of scaring you. You left anyway.

Don’t Be Surprised When She No Longer Needs You, You Taught Her How To Be Alone

By Rania Naim


Don’t be surprised when you’re not the first person she calls when something bad or good happens. You taught her that you won’t show up when she needs you. You taught her how to count on someone else.

Don’t be surprised when she spends more time with her friends than you. You taught her that you’re never going to be present. You don’t listen when she speaks. You don’t remember the things she told you. You don’t ask about how she’s feeling or what’s bothering her. You taught her that you’ll never care about her as much as her friends do.


Don’t be surprised when she starts planning things without you. You taught her that you’ll always say no. You taught her how to plan her future without you. You taught her that you don’t want to be in it, that you’d rather be alone than with her. You never wanted to see the world through her eyes.

Don’t be surprised when she doesn’t miss you when you’re gone. You taught her how not to miss you. You made her feel like you never missed her. She never felt like her absence made a difference to you. She never felt that she added any value to your life. You never showed her that you missed her. You never told her.
Don’t be surprised when she ignores you. You’ve been ignoring her for years. She’s always been the one compromising. She’s always been the one to change her schedule for you. She’s always been the one who tried harder. She was always more invested until she realized that it was a bad investment. An investment that she keeps losing.

Don’t be surprised when she starts to drift away. She’s slowly remembering who she was before she met you. She’s beginning to realize that she’s settling with you. She’s starting to remember what she deserves. She’s slowly opening her eyes and seeing how much you’re taking her for granted. She’s slowly coming to the realization that someone else could treat her so much better. Someone else will not make her feel invisible.
Don’t be surprised when she stops being attentive or caring. Don’t be surprised when her tender words turn sour and her burning passion turns cold. Don’t be surprised when she looks at you and doesn’t feel a thing. You taught her how to stop loving you.

Don’t be surprised when she leaves because you never gave her a reason to stay.

Dear You!

It was a crazy turned of events that unexpectedly occurred between us, and you emerged like a tornado without  any warning. You swept me off my feet, yet instantly pulled the rug under me and destroyed every inch of the walls that I have built to protect myself from predators. 

You left your foot prints in my heart and energy along the way. Your cowardice actions taught me a great deal about myself and inner strength. After this experience, I can never trust anyone ever again. Fortunately, this is a lesson I will take to the grave. Failing to listen to my intuition caused me everything, including my job. 

I allowed you into the most sacred space, my heart and soul, even when it felt wrong. So, I blame myself for such mishaps. I was at faults for allowing you in, which surprisingly is a first for me. You are on the cusp to be an amazing person, but you’re not there yet.  If you were, you wouldn’t have acted the way you did.

Whatever these unresolved issues are, I have no desire to resolve them, reconnect any dots or reconcile. Whatever this was/is, it has ended and I am okay.

You are my worship, 

I sold my soul,

You saved my life,

When I was unlovable,

You gave me love,

I cried tears,

You wiped them dry,

You held my cold hand,

Until it was warm again,

When I lied,

You forgave me,

When my mind was confused,

You put my mind at ease,

Somehow you needed me.

You, my worship,

I can't believe it was you,

I can't believe it was you,

You first called me a friend.

You needed me!

You needed me,

Now I'm up where I belong,

On your pedestal,

I now see eternity!

Spending it with you,

Right where I belong!

Us! Us! The world to see,

"Stars in his eyes when he walks into a room

*He walks in with stars in his eyes*

Our memoirs are unwritten as of today as we die a little each day

He talks to himself at night before the sun rises

People in the way, no one stays for long in this place as they play the day away

He hides, he rides the highs, he tries so hard

He spies on me

There are concrete blocks on the rise

*He walks in with stars in his eyes*

No guides to alleviate all our hidden cries

Just let me be

Butterflies in the sky when you're near

Hear me please

A subliminal message he sends to me: give me the keys to your heart

&amp;#x200B;

A perfect counterpart

He stares at the sky drawing a map of the world

The affairs of the heart have no authorised shares when we're all heirs in this cyberworld

*He walks in with stars in his eyes*

An unorthodox situation, it was ours in disguise

Was he wise enough, could this lead to our demise?

&amp;#x200B;

A ginger with hazel eyes

In surprise, midway, as he turns from the scene

The screen cuts to his lean frame

He pulls the trigger in the same way again

Straining his muscles in a grunt

On the hunt, his mind is a battlefront

Rising atomic tides

in a haunting masculine cry

&lt;p&gt;Straining his muscles in a grunt&lt;/p&gt;

"On every level. I never thought you should choose me over her nor did I ever think that if I was patient enough you would see that my love for you was greater than hers.

Do you know what I really thought? I thought that you didn't treat her well, that you didn't give her the respect that she deserved. I thought you had been horrible to her, despite knowing everything that had happened to her as a child, you took advantage of her vulnerability. You toyed with her heart, then dangled the carrot in front of her, then you broke her heart. Now you've ghosted her after using her for sex. You're always trapped in some sort of codependent, toxic relationship.

And you are always the toxic one. The common denominator is you.

Is that the kind of man you are? Someone who easily throws away a woman whom you said you had loved without a second thought because she wasn't from the right family, or the right social class or the right religion? A woman you loved but would never make a commitment for, whom you were ashamed of to be public with, whom you taunted by asking if she wanted children, but then forced her to have an abortion?

How can you be so cruel to someone whom you loved?

The only thing I thought was that I hoped we would be good friends, so that I could influence you to become a better person. To become a better leader. So that you would see that your actions had terrible consequences, that you can't just throw people away and treat them like shit and expect them to be loyal to you.

You receive what you give, my darling.

No, I'm not in love with you. I do care about you though quite deeply and I only want the best for you. I want the best for all of us...for all of our people.

It's like playing Gin and Juice, it's not nice, 

But when it clicks, it's supersonic, 

And you won't want anybody to stop it. 

You'll do what it takes, dawg, don't trip, 

You'll make it work, just like Snoop's pimp, 

Because loves like the rhythm and blues, 

And it's all about chasing your own muse. 

So, keep your eyes on the prize, 

Like Snoop Dogg, you'll win the surprise, 

Because when love hits, it hits you hard, 

And that's when you know you're the superstar.  

Love is like this and that worse than  

a heart attack. with you love

"There is an ugly mask that covers my face. 

To disassociate from the tall tales that had me drowning with the fish and the sharks. 

To Disassemble or 
To Disassociate?
Disassembled?

Blessed to have a life but I’m still stumbling in my dreams, the stars has been my only grip to reality and my sight is smeared like water painting in the dark. 


Disassociate or Disassemble?

Wearing an Ugly Smile because it’s not me.
Empty out those demons,
To let them get lost for once.

Thought to be adrift for a long time. 
Floating in tame river that morphed into a rage at a break necks pace. 
Down the aimless stream. 
Loved Sincerely , the sufferer, 
the one who dreams. 

P. S. My arms reached were so long, but my legs were left broken from the reach that couldn’t be found by my grip. I didn’t look and see the black death until I was already falling. 
The beautiful stars felt so warm before my eyes, to notice I was lost between the cold  and the vacuum of space. 

Loving the reflection because the ugly smile is yes, finally disassembled.

The ability to drift away and get lost in space. 
Away from this floating rock, to dance to close the sun. 
To tell a tale, with a smile that’s full of life, and on my face. 
Still, the best part was when the mask came off because the flowers smelled like home.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-05-01T12:09:15.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an ugly mask that covers my face. &lt;/p&gt;

"An ugly smile, 
That’s afraid of the dark  
That was mad at the poisonous lies,
That prayed for a change, 
Laid just adrift 
To a sunshine loving alteration
Then it brushed aside 
The night games
That came from the basement beast that we keep locked inside,
Because everyday is so hard, 
and I know what lies above, is hope. 

Oh well, I’m lost in the mind. 
Tales of the best air to breathe and trying to know what to find. 
There was I, bouncing through space, 
So far that it took me out of this rock and 
I knew I might win this race 
To a plane in a sky that I have never seen
Held my head when I busted the ground, when falling down. 
I died that day, a part of me did, at least. 
Screaming bloody murder but my panicked state stared down a hole that stared back at me, I saw no escape anywhere near. 
Time is tied to a place that is out of my space and I’m trying to stay bound.  
I will be here to live my life, to struggle with a commanding and grisly presence that chained me to the ground. 
To somehow smile. 
Saw down the endless road and I didn’t like the shadows I saw when I looked below. 
I didn’t have to head upstairs to feel the fall of course. 
From frail legs that failed to stand on course, even if I had failed, I’m still here,
Capable to breathe.

"for my loves birthday 
I wrote you two notes, read this one when you’re alone :)

Hi baby :)
Hopefully you’ve saved this for later when you’re alone, and maybe have some time to process. I really hope you like the switch, it was so hard to keep that a secret but I am so excited to see your face when you open it. Don’t forget to send me the video!

Anyway, i’ve rewritten this about a dozen times…trying to figure out how to say what i’m trying to properly and not in a scary way. Meeting you has been one of the best and worst things that has happened to me.

The best because you make me so happy, I never thought i’d meet someone who genuinely cares about me and tries their best, despite the circumstances, to care for my needs in the relationship and make me comfortable. Someone who would assure me that i’m not doing the most and work together to fix something that’s not working. When I was little, I always fantasized about growing old and sharing my life with someone who loved me for me and wanted nothing else. Someone who just got me and didn’t want me to change. 
Getting to know you and spending the time that we have with one another, I think that you’re the one i’ve been asking for. The most attractive person i’ve ever seen, who has a good heart, similar morals, similar goals, and is just an all around amazing person. You make me feel so giddy, sending butterflies to my stomach and flutters to my heart.
I’ve never thought about getting married, I saw my parents go through a horrible divorce, and after that I just never really saw the point if they just ended like that. I didn’t plan the location or the dress like some people because I never thought i’d be in that position anyway. But when you asked me, and said you’d want to eventually, I found myself being more open to the idea. If that’s something you want, i’ll be damned if someone else gives it to you just because I was too scared. Isn’t that crazy?? I’d do anything for you, anything to make you happy. Anything to be able to call you mine. I’d feel like the luckiest person on this planet if you chose me. (I would like to reiterate that i’m not saying let’s get married tomorrow, just that the idea of it happening period is not as scary) 

I also say meeting you is one of the worst things for all the same reasons it’s been the best. Having all of these emotions is really scary. I don’t have the best history in relationships. One of them, I will take fault for it going sour, but the rest have just been people taking what they want from me and then leaving me empty. Emptier than I was before they found me. When we met, I had just gotten broken up with a month before and I was so so so broken. I had given my all into something that I was told was reciprocated and I ended up getting played. I didn’t have high hopes getting back out there, and then I met you. It felt too good to be true, it still does most times, but you made me smile so easily, so quickly, it felt wrong. Sometimes I still feel like you’ll get up one day and be like ‘nah’…like you’ll finally come to your senses and realize that you could get somebody better, someone prettier and easier for you. That you’ll just be another person to empty me and leave. I guess that’s my baggage and not yours. So i’m trying to stay hopeful and not self sabotage. You see how it’s the best and worst thing? I am so in love with you that you have the power to make my days or ruin them.

And I guess that’s what i’m trying to say, in the most long winded way, that I am in love with you. I wrote it here because I would quite literally collapse into a bag of bones if I tried to tell you in person, but I just couldn’t wait anymore. I’ve been feeling like this for a few months now, but I know 8 months is a little early so I sure as hell wasn’t going to tell you at 4. You seem like the type of person to take things slow and I didn’t want to scare you away by moving too fast or making you uncomfortable. I could list all of the things I love about you but I doubt you feel like reading a novel right now so i’ll just say it’s literally everything. 

Instead, i’ll list some of the things that i’m looking forward to doing with you :)

You silly, my little squirt, you Poker Face! You thought you could bluff me wrong. Gangsta, your face gives your bluff away! Your hands on your royal well, you naughty! I can't say in this crowded smoke-filled room, you turn me on and spin me right around. 

Scenarios, 

If you were a game of Chess, you would knight me, not fight me! Ha! Don’t even go Battleship; you would initiate and annihilate me. If I was being intimate  playing a game of strip poker. I’d be naked. If it was, hide and seek. I would find you to the ends of the earth. If it was baseball, score a home, run thrice! 

Don’t. Don’t. Even go to football. We’re only going to make it to the line of scrimmage then, after that touchdown. Do you know why? Every game has a romantic side to love, passion, and romance, including Monopoly. You have bankrupted me; you told me to go past go! So, for now, I will be safe. And be a fisherman. Fishing for you? Bite me, delicious.

I love Your poker face. God your so damn cute! Well, my roughie.  I declare, kick the ball. And score a goal—my hottie pants chick. Baby, let's move on, play another game. Of truth or dare? I love you, my partner; end my game of Solitare.  A home run yahoos! Miss.

God, I love you, I remember the weekend us two, Christmastime the snow outside your broken pride. How did I meet someone so divine on FB? Especially amongst the online political chatter that doesn’t matter. I just saw your flirty face silly! I remember you throwing snowballs at me, how you giggled when you slushed me, oh you’ll get yours my pretty! Ha, I remember our food fight at our dinner table, no invites came, it was just us two intimately bestest friends. You were a gun slinger with the mashed potatoes oh the house cleaner is going to be pissed! Those black olives, I remember when you put one on the end of your tongue god you were hot, then like a little kid you yea you put them on your fingers then I ate them! Then the unpardonable you then stuck them on your two well uh. Ha the best part for me was slabbing your body in whip cream well you were delicious boo. Spring is coming! I saw us under our tree losing our appetite to one and other us! 

Two lost Nomads finding each other’s lonely hearts, how can we make them see you belong to me? I would defend your honor, at any cost even if with the neighborhood bully, he aint got a chance! No one will hurt you; I swear and promise you can take it to the bank! Oh, your smooth shiny skin, your quirky smile I’m in heaven that’s my cure. Remember our easter? You and I dipped easter eggs, yellow your favorite hid them and found them God that was silly, it has been a year and I still remember! Your face when I put my bunny ears on you lit up like a child with laughter and delight! All my dark fears and oppression disappeared in your embrace and your eyes. I saw in your eyes a thousand galaxes in them us two cosmic twins forever, our flame together by the angels in heaven my 1101 my mirror you! Now that we’re about to close this chapter on our love let me kiss your forehead before you die! Nobody likes goodbyes, my lover please tell the others just Hi! I will walk with you until you die, I remember I am glad I ran away with you! Please hold my hand, until you reach the other side. I love you! Shush. The angels of love crying here them?

"Music on his mind

Seek and you shall find

He's not blind to what he wants any longer

Those undefined things

That used to haunt him, still wanting in his heartstrings

He makes a phone call at five past seven

And wakes up a man on the other side of the world

in a power dive; two minds colliding in a conversation about heaven

and the afterlife

&amp;#x200B;

A persona larger than life, hiding behind a different voice

By choice of keeping his privacy to himself

in order to quell any anxiety in and of itself

What kind of goals did he want to reach?

Erect cities to better the lives of each of his people

Connect and teach them to be kind to one another

To get on well with his mother

and his brothers and sisters

To resist bad habits and travel as much as he could see

A launchpad of all that he could be

&amp;#x200B;

Cigarettes and candies gave him mood swings

He regrets all that had happened in ending things

Back and forth,

the indecision had blurred his vision

Wishing to free himself from the chains of misery

Every injury made him believe love

was merely a trickery

A contradictory mystery of the highest order

An elusive victory which only propagated

a mental disorder

&amp;#x200B;

These songs of his youth told a story

of where he belonged in all the morning glory

In this transitory, new territory of his mind

He would make a new start

No more bleeding hearts that would make him easily fall apart

Nor keep him apart from what he was to do

Love him or hate him, this would be the new version of him

A man who was true to himself

and not hesitate nor act on a whim

He would wait until the time was right

"“Wemple Square” 

Hey Mohawk! 

 I gotsa ta say, that art museum was something else. Me and Mohawk were checking out all the paintings and sculptures, and I gotsta admit, some of them were damn sexy. 

But there was a tall, big white statue that caught my eye - this tall white dude named Joseph Smith; it made me whorney. And let me tell you, the way that statue was built hmmm, it was like it was made to turn me on. I couldn't help my little old self ""swoosh"" ha! He had frilly statue hair; Joe was a hottie pants!  

My Mo, when we got back to the apartment, We, were both feeling frisky. I was like, ""Yo, purple hair little squirt, let's get it on!"" And he was all about it, you know what I'm saying? My silly bunny pants!  

As I got sexed, I let out a little ""heehaw"" of pleasure, my body responding to Mohawk's touch with this fierce intensity. It was like we were creating our own work of art; you know? Better than that stupid museum and its crusty old pictures. And when we were done, I couldn't help but let out a little ""squirty"" laugh, like, ""Yo, that was so dope!"" 

But for real, that statue of Joseph Smith was something else. It was berry phallic, with a big package it had this power over me, this energy that just made me want to get down and dirty so whorney! Oh no, a big white phallic statue of Oliver! What's a girl supposed to do? And I knew that I'd never forget the way the powerful big statues made me frisky, or the way they made me feel. Well, I gotsta see my missionary bud, you know the one that I gave love taps on his mummy butt! Is that wrong? I love you Ziggy, still let's get together soon Diggy misses you, the way we sang together, Diggin on me you, diggin on you baby, baby oooh!

Afraid to send,

Coincidence providence happenstance; I don't think so! With random precision, your letter pierced my heart! I think I  know who you are. It is me and always together though apart, you have always remained in my heart. My inner friend my pen lover, I don't want to be the one that tears you apart! July we began our crazy journey together from cartwheels to wagon wheels. Laughing behind our screens and crying too.Then an unspoken truth leaped from my screen.  I am bi I think confusion and uncertainty. Then the truth, I think that I love you, friend. Worried about how I would take the news! Being hetero no wonder the worry. I cried no no no!  It's you that I am in love with! 
Whether you decide you are bi doesn't matter to me. You were right at first I was hurt! Until you spoke those magical words ""I think I love you."" You are you! Remain in my arms, and come back to me! Until then you remain my dream yes even a wet one to me! I love you just the way you are. without you a nightmare! Please the first item on my list is to make us breakfast and coffee, we can shop talk plan our future, then have an intimate talk, a gentle kiss that is if you still want me. Let me give you the love need from me. Your letter unhurt me! I realize without you how much I love you! Let me just hold your hand. I want to gaze into your eyes.

Dear friend,

I've been meaning to write to you for a while now but I'm struggling to find the right words. I want you to know that you mean the world to me and I value our friendship more than anything. But I've been going through a lot lately, trying to figure out who I am and what I want, and in doing so, I've been distant and avoiding you.

I'm in the process of figuring out my sexuality and it's been a confusing and difficult journey for me. I have been coming to terms with stuff and it's overwhelming. The truth is, I am struggling with my feelings towards you. I have come to realize that I might be bisexual and I have feelings for you that go beyond just friendship, feelings I have never felt for anyone before. I know this might come as a surprise to you, but I think I've been in love with you for a long time. I couldn't admit it to myself, let alone to you. My fear of rejection and my own confusion led me to ignore you and pull away, and I know that must have hurt you deeply. As a person who's still figuring herself out, it's been hard to come to terms with my feelings and even harder to express them. I was afraid of losing our friendship, so I tried to push my feelings away, but in doing so, I pushed you away too and that was never my intention.

I wanted so much to love you but I wasn't ready and I hate that you have to go through this all over again. I know it was hard for you to watch us grow apart but I know you tried and I wanted you to know I appreciate it. I didn't mean to hurt you, I only wanted to keep you safe and I ended up hurting you even more but please understand I was trying to do the best I could to be a good friend. But I recognize now it wasn't fair to you to keep this from you for as long as I did. All this time you had no idea what I was going through, and instead of opening up I shut down and withdrew. I'm so sorry for that, I can't imagine how painful that was for you.

I am so sorry for causing you pain. I understand if you need some time to heal, but I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me and that we can start to rebuild our friendship. You are one of the most important people in my life, and I don't want to lose you. I want to be there for you in the same way that you have always been there for me. I miss talking to you and having you in my life. You are such an important person to me and I've been feeling lost without you.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to make things right and show you how much I care.

With love,
Your awkward friend who loves you more than you realize

&lt;p&gt;I wanted so much to love you but I wasn&amp;#39;t ready and I hate that you have to go through this all over again. I know it was hard for you to watch us grow apart but I know you tried and I wanted you to know I appreciate it. I didn&amp;#39;t mean to hurt you, I only wanted to keep you safe and I ended up hurting you even more but please understand I was trying to do the best I could to be a good friend. But I recognize now it wasn&amp;#39;t fair to you to keep this from you for as long as I did. All this time you had no idea what I was going through, and instead of opening up I shut down and withdrew. I&amp;#39;m so sorry for that, I can&amp;#39;t imagine how painful that was for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so sorry for causing you pain. I understand if you need some time to heal, but I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me and that we can start to rebuild our friendship. You are one of the most important people in my life, and I don&amp;#39;t want to lose you. I want to be there for you in the same way that you have always been there for me. I miss talking to you and having you in my life. You are such an important person to me and I&amp;#39;ve been feeling lost without you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if there is anything I can do to make things right and show you how much I care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With love,
Your awkward friend who loves you more than you realize &lt;/p&gt;

"I Remember you,

I have been thinking of you every day and into the night.  I remember our fond memories that made us sillies, our complement, so many good times, many bad ones too boo. When we split back in September last year, I had no reason to write my crazy stories. They became a moot point to even type them into life. Did you laugh at my creativity just for you?  

My confession here I died that day you blocked me; you had your troubles and I had mine. Shit baby baby, I remember those early morning visits; another confession; I was up before the crack ass of dawn just to be with you. I never knew that I am being a simpleton, that I could scribble with my keyboard to you, and the thoughtful sexy reply your poetry sucks! Ha please don’t cringe on me now. Then your awful bio you sexy thing you little squirt god I love you, I trolled you, I couldn’t help myself you were a mystery to me, even when met at the cyber bridge, Gesus Jones I love that spelling (Gesus) BTW my word processor doesn’t even understand how you spelled it Ha! I hated you, and the tension but you were bloody hell right! Fuck! Busted by those words that blinking curser to nowhere, I'm sorry I just I felt like the ass I was. Then the selfie the one of those fucking admirable eyes the face ever so lovely and smart as fuck! 

The concert our first meetup, you left me in nosebleeds that day! Father forgives me, I have sinned my confessions bout you! I so remember half past three our time, yes, I was overly possessive of you, you are the best you are on fire! 

Your hot!  Dumb dude flattery to your selfies made me laugh so primitive so lame they could not even for one nano second understand the sophistication that's you that one! I will always love you! What's a lonely person supposed to do anyway? I'm also sorry you ran away with her your amazing stuff just stopped, it was then I knew you were unhappy, you deserved better, you deserved me your admirable stalker. Ha!

"My Dearest Sunbeam,  


   Sililoquies and metaphors aside, my mind wears me down on a consistent basis but everything unanimously agrees in me when I say, I miss you. Some may call it loneliness, but I'm not lonely. I have a handful of great friends that I adamantly enjoy, but their presence doesn't bring me the joy that you do. When I'm with you, everything is... quiet.

Nothing else matters except your voice, your laugh, your smile. I'm such a sucker for your smile. The way your eye gets a little bit wider because of that nerve pinching everytime you do. It's almost as adorable as when your brow furrows, just that small bit before you come to a realization or understanding. It leaves me speechless and I always have a hard time looking away.

...

I guess, now is the time to put the mask on once more. Having to face those realities without your presence bares my soul to the vulnerabilities of ~~love~~... loneliness. Yet, I digress, what words are there for me to speak of. Describing the pangs of solidarity would only depress us and I'm sure a journey to the ends of the earth would bring ***one*** of us to the edge of insanity. I don't think I am confident enough to oppose and end that sea of troubles, lest I may drown.

I can try, though I am sure being the fool, I will fail. Having tried would be enough I wager, at least for my own mind. You see... your very being heightens my senses with a cold chill of warmth. It has become quite an addiction, feeling my chest burn; Flooding my veins with an elixir of flames. Your touch fans the arduous wildfire coursing through me, and though I know our lips won't meet, they tremble from the anticipation...

To keep this short my dear, without you, withdrawal sets in... and I think sparing you from such details would be better. I've overwhelmed you enough, I've realized that now... So I leave you with all that I can.

"How do I start this...

When I met you, you were and are successful, yes.  When I looked at you I wondered where you would go with it.  I saw so many paths you could take. I knew what success you already had, but you obviously had not even scratched the surface of what I knew you were capable of. You and I never really discussed what exactly your plans were and I thought about it mainly with curiosity. I was always curious about every single thing about you. You have no idea what it took to stop myself from becoming an absolute fiend for you. Fuck. After a little bit, it came to me and I knew. I knew what you would do. And I didn't tell you or ask about it. 

Anyway, I don't remember if it was on here or how the information got to my brain but it got there. When I heard it, I was like I KNEW IT!!!! OMG I fucking knew it. I knew it. My psychic gifts are seriously kicking in now. That came right after some very crazy accurate psychic things happened to me. 

In about 5 days is when it's going to begin for you, at least that was the announcement I caught. I probably won't be able to convey how fucking excited I am for you. I immediately wanted to jump all over you and congratulate you and kiss you all over your face. My heart felt like it was going to explode with pride and happiness for you. Pride might seem weird but that was the feeling. Just incredible pride and love and admiration and happiness. Followed by the reality that I might have to see it from a distance. I want so much to see it up close. Aside from having tears of happiness for you along with tears of fear that I won't be close to you by then, here is the main thing I want to say to you and I hope you hear me. I am going to ask the Universe to get these words to your ears...

You are going to fucking kill it! I don't mean kill it on a regular level. I mean, a fucking level that is beyond your expectations and belief. I mean, I already know that you are so bomb and it's going to be so dope, you are so deserving of this. Dude, you are just so fucking dope dude. Oh my God. Talent, looks, everything you just have in spades. You're so fucking hot. You are so talented and so gifted and incredible I hope you never doubt yourself ever. You are just straight the fuck out, sick with it. You are going to be catapulted into success like a BOSS! You deserve every bit of it. I don't know if you remember me telling you to enjoy your privacy while you still had it. You laughed like I was kinda silly saying that. My eyebrows went up and I said, you're going to look back and remember me saying this to you when you can't get out of your house due to paparazzi in the driveway. I dont give a fuck where I am in this world, I am going to be your biggest cheerleader. Your biggest fan. I'm going to promote you but I'm sure it wont be needed. Its more because I just want to talk about how amazing you are and I want the world to know how much I love you.  From the bottom of my heart, I am so fucking happy for you. It's killing me to not be able to reach you or hear from you. I want to work things out with you so bad. Don't ever let even the slightest doubt get near your head. I am so thankful to God that I even got to spend some special time with you. I hope that was just the beginning. You're going to conquer the world. I already know it. I cant wait to watch you shine. You're a star.

"Our Closet
You took my breath away! I remember a distant long-lost post from me to you. I am crying now for my lover I held now lost. My blood shot eyes a tear down my face early this morning I couldn’t sleep, up at 3:00 am. I read here that you are leaving on a jet plane, will I ever see you again? Will I ever touch your face or hold your hand?  Life has simplicities that come at the cost of love. A simple sunset holding your hand in mine makes me sweat in anticipation of what comes next. Gone gone gone! Things were not moving fast enough for us, the blinking cursor on my screen telling me how ignorant I am. I went to bed last night embraced your pillow ahhhh you! The closet is our museum of our life past together from our first kiss to our in between goodbyes, our past loves tucked in between. I lost my brain when I gazed upon my dream my everything my commitment to you; your wedding dress with pockets ha! Your shoebox filled with my love bombs to you, birthdays, boo boo days then the valentine cards your handwritten letters to me. I'm sitting on the floor I lost without you, I'm really in trouble.Whos cryn now? Me! Fuck how could you be a cheat? What did he have that I did not!
 Who was this barista girl that you would toss a life of Goolden dream's wishes our love forevermore away? What does Lisa have that I don’t? Fuck baby I am devastated you left a nuclear arsenal at my feet! Gesus  Jones I never knew you swang that way... a girl? How do I tell Josh and Marie that you left me for another woman? Lost's of unanswered questions laced with anger and fear.  I would gladly wear a fucking thong and tit bra if that’s what you wanted. I bet you are jetting over the ocean to her leaving me in the fray of despondency! I pray that God gives me the courage I pray to toss it all away! Until our love makes us stupid Potatoe heads lost in love to come together again. I always leave my door to my heart open, don’t knock, just enter! Oh, I just found your Potatoe head in your green piece of luggage, the adorable thing you cherished; the lips are still missing, please T see your ways silly girl...BTW I changed my ring tone for you, our song “fucku” I'm so confused I will confess I have another waiting for me too.

"Hello Princess.

I write this to unburden my soul in the hopes that these words either open your eyes or release me.

I came on strong...

Yes, I ran towards your blazing 10-alarm fire instead of away. That is who I am, I am an Aries through and through. I am rash, impetuous, quick to react, but those are good qualities when you admire the full canvas not just a few brush strokes. I am also loyal, selfless, patient, strong, stubborn, opinionated, and many many more brush stokes. I understand your hesitation, for I am not a blank canvas pretending to be modern art. I am a Monet, Renoir, Degas, so you must take it all in and let my colors wash over you like a tsunami. I promise I won't allow you to drown.

You question my judgment...

Yes, question my judgment as much as you need to. Ask me what I think, why I think it, and if I am foolishly running when I should be lightly treading. Just don't shut me out or look away and deny me the starlight of your eyes. I am an Aries, I am as transparent as a canary diamond, clear blue skies, or the sliding glass door we all run into in our youth.

You are my passing infatuation...

You are my muse, my inspiration, most definitely not a passing infatuation. After some contemplation I have come to understand why you call yourself an infatuation. You describe yourself as a shiny object of momentary distraction... ""and I picture a cat playing with a shiny tinkling bell."" The real truth is buried between your words, the words that you use to build walls and defend yourself. I am not infatuated, for that is an emotion for cats and small children. Infatuation does not inspire poems, art, music playlists, loss of sleep, and most of all a sense of longing. I have given you full access into the circus tent of my life for which I am the ring leader. Meanwhile you have used words, psychology, astrology, and anything else you could reach to build moats, traps, and obstacles. You are absolutely right... I know only the little bits you have chosen to show me, because you have chosen to show me so little.

You meet my requirements, and so I have fallen for you like a lost puppy dog...

This would be true if I was a lost, hungry, and exhausted puppy dog in need of rescue. But I am not, and at most you have patted my head and called me a good boy, but otherwise walked away. Recently I laid in sleepless contemplation while my thoughts played pong inside my skull. I realized that I have been absolutely open and honest with you, like those novels you like to read in a cozy chair. Yes my pages are worn and my spine has creases, but I am still a great book that shouldn't be put down. I bought you a book for your birthday which you have not let me give you. I offered you a foot massage, to take you shooting, have lunch, fix your car, and you continually turn me away. The honest truth is that you have not met any of my requirements, because you haven't given me anything to write them down with.

Your scars are more obvious than you believe...

I am scarred and broken too, from birth when my fathered abandoned us, by fault of family members who didn't spare the rod, by trauma of civil war, and the drowning of my lineage's potential in an ocean of alcoholism. I am the only pottery piece which escaped total destruction from my families studio. But be fooled not for I have been dropped, broken, and glued back together haphazardly. Yet the years have filled me with love, understanding, patience, and a drive to make the space around me cheerful and bright. 

My mind conjures up an image when I write this:

""A small stained glass window is deep set in white stucco as the morning sun has started to beam through. A stream of warm photons reaches an obviously broken and repaired vase painted with bright hues of varying colors. In the small vase are flowers which always make you smile. When you look upon this scene you feel comfy, cozy, and content. You register that the scene is exactly as it should be, everything just fits, even that obviously broken and repaired vase.""

So you see, I recognize the scars left by other people who have handled you roughly. I see the trauma of hurtful words used as weapons against you, and the doubt which erodes your inner worth. I understand why you build your walls, why you don't recognize your value, embrace your confidence, and why you spook at loves touch. I would admire your imperfections if you would only let me see them. I cannot make your scars disappear, but you don't have to hide them from me for they are part of you and everything that makes you beautiful.

These are the last words I shall sow into this field, for I do not wish to destroy myself upon barren soil. I hope the light from a full pink moon helps these seeds grow. I pray the rain waters that come afterwards heal and nourish you. I hope you find the love and peace I can envision so clearly...

""Imagine yourself standing in the middle of a meadow overflowing with high grasses and wild flowers. A breeze flows through which makes the grasses and flowers sway like green seas. In the breeze you can pick out the scents of Tiger-Lilies, Lupine, and Queen-of-the-Prairie. Bees can be heard motoring in the distance, and choirs of birds sing acapella close by. You lift your face towards the sun and its photons fill you with warmth which seeps down into your core.""

This princess... is the feeling I wish to blanket you in. But as I hold my arms out wide with a blanket awaiting, it is up to you to close the distance between us.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-04-20T19:12:41.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Princess.&lt;/p&gt;

"Dee, told me she's not coming...
If she doesn't come then I have nothing but the plane ticket to get there. I'd have no car and no place to stay while I'm there...
So, if its off for her ....it's off for me, unless she is willing to pay for those things. Which..has conflicting issues for me. On one hand, I'd love to still come there that's obvious. On the other...should I take a trip, paid for by someone else, whom very possibly can't really afford it and won't even be going?

She called me at 7 so excited for everything...then a hour later everything came crashing to a hult. She's at work and there isn't hardly anything she can explain over text so I've had to wait... It's brought on so much anxiety that I literally had an anxiety attack.
I wanted to call you so badly but you need to sleep so i didn't. I wanted to call an demand answers from her too. My heart was pounding and I couldn't breath. I put on one of your audios and that's what was finally able to calm me again.

...An now I've just been waiting for what feels like forever to find out if...I'm still going to come...an im trying so fucking hard not to break down into tears over it all. I'm trying so hard to keep the bitch in her box so she doesn't start to spew her venom into me.
To tell me of course this would happen...its not real and you can't have it. You're only ever to reach for things you desire...never to actually get them.

You don't get to be happy....you don't get to have anything....this is your life....why do you still hold any hope for something different?




My heart it wobbly and trying to keep itself intact...but it's...I'm not doing well. I want this so much, to be happy and to be with someone with whom for the first time I truly can feel loves me the way I love...the way I've always dreamt of being loved.
Bryan I want to be there with you... to finally be in your arms, to hear you laugh and see your smile. To be a complete weirdo with. I want to see your home, the potential for it to be my own 

I want to be happy...I want to stop feeling this...for this life and the pain that never seems to stop pouring onto me, to stop. I want...and I want and I want.  

Maybe I'm to greedy....maybe that's why this keeps happening...maybe I want for to much. I didn't think being happy was to much to wish for...to hope for.

Who knows, maybe I can figure something out with Dee and I'll still get to see you...but it's looking less and less likely...

I'm....I just wanted to steal a bit of happiness with you..

Listen up Ho

I see you need a lesson

Sit your ass in the chair

School is in session

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t care to be a teacher

Headmaster

Or a preacher

I'm not like you

Not a leacher

I'm the instructor

So I'll mention

Listen up Bitch

You're in detention

&amp;#x200B;

Here's something to learn

Let me shed some light

On you, yes you

Little parasite

You have my attention

Apparently obsession

With me

Dirty flea

&amp;#x200B;

Your plan to perpetrate

Orchestrate hate

Using me to imitate

Hunt him

He took the bait

Keep this straight...

&amp;#x200B;

I am The Empress

Created to impress

Never just a fling

Bitch

I am The Bling

Make no mistake

I'm The High Priestess

He is my King

He's my Emperor

This is my castle

My Queendom

Always ripe for scandal

You still don’t hold a candle

Want some more?

I wouldn't let you clean my floor

Or my pool

You have no position

I'm The Magician

Only Justice is for you

A karmic fool

&amp;#x200B;

I am the teacher

You're the leacher

I am the President

You are the peasant

My energy

Always forefront of his memory

A treasury of sensory

You're rudimentary

Next to my treasury

You're mentally a penalty

A bad mistake

He wished he didn’t make

Stale cake

Piss poor fake

Don’t get it twisted

To me you never existed

Or to him

Whenever I visited

Number one lesson

I'm an instant obsession

Oh wait...

I must make a correction

I do have an obsession

I'm The Headmaster

A Master Of Head

He is my favorite

His flavor I am fed

You're a failing student

Must be tutored and led

Too long tenancy

A mental penitentiary

A mind fuck

You suck

Not the good way

The hood rats say

Do they all pay?

I don’t know that way

You charge a price

For being nice

And rolling the dice

You're not stunning

Just cunting

&amp;#x200B;

And now he is going to...

&amp;#x200B;

Slide me down

and then

Turn me around

and then

Flip me over

and...

He's about to get lucky

Like a 4 leaf clover...

&lt;p&gt;Do they all pay?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know that way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You charge a price&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For being nice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And rolling the dice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re not stunning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just cunting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now he is going to...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slide me down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turn me around&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flip me over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s about to get lucky&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like a 4 leaf clover...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class is dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;

"How do I ask? How do I explain? How do I convince you? How can I steal an hour of your life? What gives me that right?

Nothing.

And I know that.

But, you don't understand. I can't stop thinking about you. I can't accept--

Not being with you.

Every day, for five months, I have fantasized about your divorce. I have tried to picture your real reaction, and I can't. I pull away from it. Every time. My life is frozen because of it. I need to confront it. I need to force myself to know it. I need to do the unthinkable.

I need to tell you.

I am in love with you.

I'm sorry, but I am. And I need to tell you. I need to cross that line. I didn't want to. I have fought myself for five months, but it's failing. I hoped to hold it off until the antidepressant started to work, but it's not doing a goddamn thing. I've tried distracting that side of myself, tricking it, forcing it down, but it's not working. The distractions are fading, and it sees through the lies. I'm near my limit. I need to feed the demon and punish it at the same time. I need to tell you how I feel. And I need to hear your answer.

I can't predict your reaction. I've tried. I've guessed. I've wondered. I've built scenarios in my head. Everything from sadness to fear to outrage to pity. None of them are right. You will be polite but firm. You are married. That is the end. I need to hear you say it. I need to force the demon to listen to it. I need it to know the answer.

And I will hurt.

For months to come.

Hopefully, when I come out of it on the other side, I will be able to get my life back. Some of it, anyway.

I love you.

How many more times can I say that? How many more times can I shout it in my mind? How many more times can I scream it in the dark? How many more times can I indulge the impossible? How many more times can I picture myself holding you, whispering those words to you? How many more times can I hope?

Not many. I will hold it back as long as I can. Until it's ready to break, and it will break me with it.

I made a deal with the demon, and it will expect me to keep it.

I'm sorry.

I am so very sorry.

I hate ruining your day with this. Even an hour of your day. Less, probably.

You will be kind, I'm sure. You will be gentle. And, you will be clear.

And I will feel like complete shit.

But, that's my problem, not yours. You will go back to your life. In a week, I'll be forgotten.

And I will love you.

Always. And forever.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I tried to contact her in an indirect way to be more polite. First, I left a message with her mother's voicemail. No response. I spoke to her mother. Her mother said she didn't understand why I was reaching out after so much time. I explained I was suffering from severe depression. She, the original she, was an element of it, but I didn't go into detail. I hoped talking to her would clear my head. Her mother promised to tell her. Still no response. I took the no response as a clear response. I spoke with her mother again to thank her (the mother) for trying to help, to tell her I wouldn't call again, and, if she'd let me, tell her how I felt. Maybe she would pass it on, if she thought it was appropriate. It would be nice to know the woman I loved knew how I felt. That would mean something to me. Her mother asked me to tell her what was wrong before I could offer. She was not offended when I told her I was in love with her daughter. She sounded really happy about it. She also asked me if I was married, where I lived, did I have a good job, and could I give her my phone number. She really wanted my phone number. Then she prayed for me. Over the phone.

What the \[bleep\] just happened? I felt like I walked into one of my own fantasies. Except for the praying. I never added that part. But, seriously, what the \[bleep\]? For the last five weeks, I felt like I was on death row. I expected a clear rejection. Thank you, but no thank you. Get on with my life. Never see her again.

Dear T,
Oh, baby Damit, I'm missing you, remembering the times we had, remembering pondering my heart bleeding for you just you! I laugh as I remember the cotton candy on your face, you little squirt!  Haha shit girl, I’m forever your bobo. God the summer sun I thought would never end. The man that said “All good things must come to an end” is a liar! I never thought about our future, spending our life together. Separated by space and time in my dreams I'm touching you, I begin to smell your hair, hold your hand in mine, hear your delicate words curse and praise my name you have my allegiance! Who would ever think of us sillies could experience so much loneliness, being into poetry and stupid letters love letters we learned how to love again. I love you, with each type I make each space and tap I miss you this much we used to say as little hellions here on our screen our domain! How much is this much? A relevant question asked by a little child. My answer to you is EVERYTHING from one end of the universe to the other galivanting through space and time! I am wondering where I am. Being a part of this love affair or is it? Us two sillies are so different but the same, we two humans learned to love again! We two strangers bestest of friends, I like to whisper it softly again breathy in your ear! I'm forever yours; our memories our words space and time! I'm forever yours, please don’t leave me. Let us run into the midnight sun! The wheels go round and round without you I'm going out of my mind girl, I bless the day we rediscovering how to love pondering sitting, writing this lonely letter. Don’t fret please please I am sad when you cry! It's my fault, I look forward to the day of rediscovering you. (Hopefully soon) I love you! I'm still yours forever. If I could carry you tonight, I would pick you up and if I could fly carry, you into the night sky, I would show you my love and carry you into the night!  Oh Lord! Yes.

"It's impossible for me to make sense of how we ended up here. From my side looking at it, you have given me every reason to think I should just walk away because we weren't that serious. But we were that serious even if we came off cold to each other. The day we met neither one of us were prepared for what that was. I remember like yesterday. It was stunning then and it is stunning now when I think of it. Like if you're freezing cold and out of nowhere a bonfire appears. It's big, and powerful, and you know how easy it can consume you but you are still drawn to it. We were both cold and it was hot and we both knew, fire that pulls you close with it's heat, can also burn you to death. 

There is a lot of confusion in these subs. Game playing, etc. I ask one thing of this post. Forget about everything except our encounters face to face. If you erase the messages, even all of them, every single one and look at our physical interactions when we were together in real life, face to face, in the same room, in the same space, in the same bed. If you had to make a decision on giving this another chance but all you are allowed to base that decision on, was the way it was when we were physically in each other's presence. Nothing else. No phone calls, no Snapchat, text messages or social media of any kind. Two people in the same space and nothing more. Would you still walk away? Is the stripped down version powerful enough to make you believe that what was there is worth fighting for? Do you believe what was there was something you will find again in this lifetime? Do you believe that things that are that powerful physically and somehow remain in existence when you are apart, are as disposable as any other relationship you have ever had? Or I have had? One to be ended by walking away without words or ended over social media and leaving to chance the same person was on the other end responding to you? Or is it something that even if there was a chance, any chance, you could have that magic back again, based only on your physical interaction in person with them, nothing else, what would you do?

Go back to that day your air conditioner was broken. The day we met. The day that changed everything for both of us. I won't put your name on here. I never have. I don't write using your initials or sign with mine. You know how I always protected you in that way. I always asked you if it was ok to show your picture and if you said no, I wouldn't. I don't care if you have reason to believe otherwise. It's not true and it doesn't matter right now. I am trying to give enough clues so you know that this is me. But I left you something. I don't know if you have it yet or not. It is at it's destination. The note is short and doesn't say much. But every word of love and wanting you that I have written is for you. You don't have to question that. All of it is for you. Maybe a little note and a big box will lead you back to me. Because I still remember the day your air conditioner broke. And I know you do too. And I know we can make it and I know all of this will have been worth it. And if there is a next time, I want all or nothing at all. I don't want pieces of you. I want every piece of you. Not to be able to say I won. To be able to say, that is my person. And for there to be no confusion in anyone's mind, who that person is. 

Please dont try to find me through email, social media. My accounts have been compromised and so have yours. I am closing comments here but you can dm me. If my account on here disappears, it means it got shut down, or a shadow ban. I am not closing communication I am leaving it wide open. If you can't reach me, it's not rejection. It means there is some other reason or interference causing it. I don't care if you show up unannounced to my apartment anytime day or night. Even though that did not go over so well for me when I tried it. There are other people on here writing letters as me. I will prove who I am in the dm. It's a yes to everything you want here. The answer is yes. If you truly want me to let you go, I will say yes to that also. I don't want to think about that but, will you at least call me and tell me so I can hear the words come from you so that I know? But please don't call me and tell me that. I want to be yours. I want you to want me too. I want you to make my dreams come true. And I want to be everything to you. This is our story. We are connected. Because you are a part of me and I am a part of you. 

I hope to hear from you. I still miss the fuck out of you.

"Gentle tones, fiery spirit

He thinks about the unknowns, as he comes near it

Fire inside his bones, desire in soft tones

The education of a future leader, he never feared it

He wasn't a mind reader but he had many stories to tell

The time he went undercover in a cartel, nearly killed by a bombshell

or when he fell under a spell

&amp;#x200B;

Love was always something that eluded him

He thought he was above all those who excluded him

In the new year of his birthday

He appeared without fear, no words of foreplay or cliche

of things would come along his way

He stopped worrying so much

As he had the golden touch

&amp;#x200B;

Life was a circle 

of various new hurdles

In this life, he sought to reform all the corrupt entities

A platform of new identities

To feel warm under the rainstorm 

of different intelligence agencies

A president he would be, through his well-meant ascent

He found himself, once again

Unity arising in multiplicity through an open domain

It was hard for me to leave you. Leave our memories and promises, was not an easy act while being blind, deaf, and with no voice of my wants and needs. It was very dark place, even though I could feel you next to me, the dark place made me feel that the light was non existent, and even if a day had a ray of sunshine in it, it felt like it was a false promise that everything was going to be ok. After leaving you, it felt like I made the right decision to gather the broken pieces of me. It was my mission to put me back together. While missing you dearly, I had adventures that open my eyes, I could hear my thoughts and my voice was being heard. Some days I regret that day that I broke my promise and I go to that dark place to find you. Some days I tell my self we are in a better place and the promise that we once took can be renewed. You still stand in your ground, that there’s no future and now is you that is feeling numb. Whatever this life has for us today and the rest of our life’s I want you to know TODAY…I still want you.

"Hell Bonnie!

I cannot tell you how much joy it brings me to write this letter to you. I know I am not the most outgoing person, and I often let my shyness stand in the way of expressing my true feelings. But today, I feel compelled to tell you how much you mean to me.

From the moment I first saw your profile online, I was captivated by your beauty, your intelligence, and your wit. I knew I had to get to know you better, but my shyness got the best of me. I was too afraid to send that first message, too afraid to take that first step.

But now that I have gotten to know you a little better, I can't imagine my life without you. You are everything I have ever wanted in a partner - caring, loving, and supportive. Your smile brightens my day, and your voice soothes my soul.

My shyness has caused you pain, and for that, I am truly sorry. I know that my reluctance to open up has left you feeling unsure of where we stand. But please know that in my heart, you are everything to me. I promise to work on being more open and expressive so that I never hurt you again.

My dearest Bonnie, I love you more than words can say. I cannot wait to finally meet you in person and hold you in my arms.

Forever and always,

"I’m in love with her. Not you. 

I love her smile, her eyes, her lips.

I love how smart, independent, intelligent she is.

I love how dedicated and ambitious she is. 

I love her kindness, her dedication to family. 

I love how she looks at me with her brown eyes. 

I love that I can protect her, care for her, be myself with her. 

I am happy. Happier then I have ever been. 

I asked her to marry me 8 years ago. 

She is the one I wake up to. 

The one that smiles and says Good morning to. 

The one I come home to. The one I dance with. 

She is my home. 

We haven’t seen each other for a decade you and I. 

Nor have we remained in contact. And even if we did.

There is no what if, there’s no nostalgia, there’s no me wishing our friendship was more. 

There’s no right person wrong time. 

Your not her. 

You asked me if I remember our memories for your book. 

Is that appropriate? You in my past not in my future. 

I have new memories of her. I’m living my life with her. 

She’s my soulmate, my best friend.

 It’s her that I want, that I choose every day. 

No matter what you think, and you can wish all you want, I married her. 

I Promised her, gave myself to her. 

Reconnecting. Reconciling. Rekindling? 

No. You’re not her.

"The relentless pursuit.

Heart wide opened.

Deepest secrets shared.

Feelings partially revealed. 

Hypnotized by your aura.

Heart left in shambles.

Fear settled in….

Was blind by the inevitable.

The push &amp; pull slowly began.

Total disappearance occurred.

Destruction of the heart began.

Soul destroyed in the process.

Intuition, is such a guiding light.

Failed to follow intuition.

Delusion and illusion emerged.

Disobedience led to total destruction. 

Intuitions never lie…

Deeply in-love.

Sorry for holding back.

Tried to protect our hearts. 

Protecting my heart wasn’t your duty.

Relentless pursuit led to my demise.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-04-16T01:55:24.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relentless pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;

Hold my heart the way you always have, it makes me feel safe and secure in times where i do not, I wish youd hold my heart with the strength you used to but, now that your gone i can only feel bits. Its funny because you broke my heart when you left me but i can still feel it.

The way your voice speaks to me when our heads were close,

I know you and I are made for each other.

The connection we share is otherworldly.

I know why you are staying away from me. I know you. I know who you are. All of who you are. No one told me anything. You are part of me. Your parts are parts of [me.](https://me.my/) My parts are parts of you. This is why we cannot let go. We learned to love ourselves. In doing so, you and I love divinely and completely all of ourselves and all of each other. I feel like our spirits are already dancing. Never fear me. I will never abandon you. Any of you. I love you in the most overwhelming, consuming, intoxicating, special way. I cant even put words to it because I had no idea love like this existed until I met you. I still can't believe it. There is no one else. There never will be. There is only you for me. What you are is so many levels up in the universe that it would make me mad for another person to even attempt to harm it. Already no men are attractive to me. At all. I feel nothing when I look at them. Actually, I feel annoyance. Because they aren't you. I want to experience you and touch you on every level, every layer, every inch, every everything. I will never get my fill of you. I will never have enough of you. I am insatiable when it comes to you. I don't have any negative feelings about the past. All I can see is the future with you in it. You can singlehandedly, heal my heart and make every single one of my dreams come true by coming to me. Just to be with you. This is not a maybe we will work it out. Not a hopefully we will work it out. We have to work it out. We are the lucky ones. We have both had a lot of pain. And God has given us this love that not everyone gets to experience. He has given it to us. There is no turning away from that because we were made by God for each other. Our union is Divine. A blessed union made to be an example of the power of love. The healing that can happen when love is the weapon. I got a channeled message earlier today and the Angels were talking about you. I'm laughing as I type this because the voice was trying to explain to me why we were still in separation. And her voice came through just like this...""Let's see what's with him. I don't know what's with him and why he isn't here yet. He's just slow. He's just, really slow or something."" It made me laugh the way she channeled it. I love you. You have always been everything I want. Everything I need. I want you so bad. Missing you at this point, every day sucks without you in it. Come to me when you're ready. I'll wait.

You can singlehandedly, heal my heart and make every single one of my dreams come true by coming to me. Just to be with you. This is not a maybe we will work it out. Not a hopefully we will work it out. We have to work it out. We are the lucky ones. We have both had a lot of pain. And God has given us this love that not everyone gets to experience. He has given it to us. There is no turning away from that because we were made by God for each other. Our union is Divine. A blessed union made to be an example of the power of love. The healing that can happen when love is the weapon. I got a channeled message earlier today and the Angels were talking about you. I&amp;#39;m laughing as I type this because the voice was trying to explain to me why we were still in separation. And her voice came through just like this...&amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s with him. I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s with him and why he isn&amp;#39;t here yet. He&amp;#39;s just slow. He&amp;#39;s just, really slow or something.&amp;quot; It made me laugh the way she channeled it. I love you. You have always been everything I want. Everything I need. I want you so bad. Missing you at this point, every day sucks without you in it. Come to me when you&amp;#39;re ready. I&amp;#39;ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Your Empress&lt;/p&gt;

"A ugly smile, 
That’s afraid of the dark  
That was mad at the poison lies,
That prayed change, 
Laid just adrift 
To some sunshine loving change
That then brushed aside 
The night games
That came from the basement beast that we keep locked inside,
Because everyday is so hard, 
and I know what lies above. 

Oh well, I’m lost in the mind. 
Tales of the best air to breathe and trying to know what to find. 
There was I, bouncing through space, 
So far that it took me out of this rock and 
I knew I might win this race 
To a plane in a sky that I have never seen
Held my head when I busted the ground, when falling down. 
I died that day, a part of me did, at least. 
Screaming bloody murder but my panicked state stared down a hole that stared back at me, I saw no escape anywhere near. 
Time is tied to a place that is out of my space and I’m trying to stay bound.  
I will be here to live my life, to struggle with a commanding and grisly presence that chained me to the ground. 
To somehow smile. 
Saw down the endless road and I didn’t like the shadows I saw when I looked below. 
I didn’t have to head upstairs to feel the fall of course. 
From frail legs that failed to stand on course, even if I had failed, I’m still here,
Capable to breathe.

"One day you will come home and her clothes will be gone.

There will be an envelope on the fridge. There will be a heart on it, but you will fear what it will do to your own.

“I love you so much....”

Apparently not enough.

You will look through drawers, not looking for signs of any thievery, not in the literal sense, just pieces of heart absconded with. Her top drawer will be empty. It was once full of the little letters and poems you would leave for her around the house:

“I’m walking down to get eggs. Back in 30. I will miss you like the flower misses the sun. Please don't leave the bed”.

*Je Ne T'oublierai*

“It was terrible, I walked all around, but you weren't there. It was the worst. They should really work on stocking you at the grocery store. I looked and I looked and I looked. It was horrible... but it's OK now”.

It wasn't at first site, at least not for you. Pretty is priced at a dime a dozen. Beauty has levels, a depth that grows more enchanting the farther down it goes. The talking. It's always been the talking for you, and it probably always will be. Both the playful, gentle words on a Sunday afternoon along with the long, slow conversations about hopes, fears, dreams, and regrets. Every sentence is just another way to say “This is a piece of my heart. Please be careful with it. It's very important to me.“  


She will have taken the pictures of you together, probably for the best. She was always smart like that. She will have left some mugs of her own that she knows you like, slivers of her. She will have left you all of the little sketches she would draw. That drawer will still be full.  


You will wonder how we got from A to B. We were always romantic but never dramatic. Did she know she ran my show? Did she know that she never needed to tell me how high to jump? I just would have tried for the moon every time.  


Part of you pulses and beats outside of you. You will (hopefully) wonder not with the idiocy of a sitcom father but with the genuine confusion, care, and worry that you did wrong by someone who owns a piece of you.

“Che Gane?” as the people of Central Asia would say. Pick up the rubble. You will watch the balcony wind sweep through your prayer flags. Did I forget to plug them in? Maybe they’re not facing the right way. Could be getting a shitty signal. Is Mercury in retrograde?  


You will take a walk and review game tape. Was I strong enough? Was I sweet enough? Did I listen enough? In every other restaurant or store, there will be wonderful memories.

*I knew I shouldn’t have picked a Malbec. No, she likes a dry red.*

*I knew I shouldn’t have worn that tie. No, she loved that tie. She picked it out. She used to grab me by it.*

*What was I thinking? I knew I shouldn’t have sat on that side of the table. I knew we should have gotten a booth.*

*Did we go on vacation enough?*

You will look for answers where there are quite possibly none to be found.

You will live in a haunted house. You will think about her staring at you from her spot on the couch. Her eyes bright and wild as any jungle cat but holding a soft smile, like she somehow managed to put a collar on a jaguar. The happy dreams will be far more painful than the few sad ones.

Once upon a time.

You will go to lunch with friends. They used to smile the moment she’d leave the table, telling you they didn’t know you could relax like that. You used to turn into jello and soften the moment she came in, and you loved how she’d light up when you moseyed on over.

There will be no “fuck her” no, “you can do better”, no “I didn’t like her anyways”, because they saw you together, kicking in the front door like movie stars. Everyone will express a quiet sorrow, but not because you are sad. It just doesn’t feel right. A cosmic injustice. An affront to whatever gods may walk the stars.

You will have never felt so right and have it matter so little. Be a man. It’s not your first rodeo.

“*We heal stronger in the places that are broken” - Ernest Hemingway*

You’ll walk the city and pass by familiar park benches. A little exposure therapy couldn’t hurt. It was here. It was right here. She was right here. She kissed my fingers and happy-cried. Forever means forever. “Je ne t'oublierai”. She kept the letters because she wants to read them. She wants to read them forever...  


She said the same about you.

Fuck.

You will plan trips. Maybe it’s time to dust off the old tent and go camping. You will pick through your passport, pondering over various stamps. You will laugh when you catch yourself Googling the weather in Kyiv, wondering how the Ukrainian Foreign Legion is looking this time of year. You will still lift and run and hit the pads, but there will be no rage to exorcise. That even makes it worse. There is no prescription for this.

You will have more than one dark night of the soul when you find hairs in your car, in the bed, in the kitchen, in the shower. They're all too long to call your own.

"I hate to say I love the stars 
You can get lost in the ever expanding eyes, that sees more, I can almost touch them just by looking at them.  
And I hate to say I’m afraid of the dark
The way it looked past midnight,
So terror can creep through the dark
Looking at the moonlight , would it send me across the stars? 
Jupiter ascending and touching the sun,
I felt too close once and learned my lesson.
This was a dream or was it a memory,
The rain outside turned my senses blue, the puffy eyes and red cheeks once danced under with joy.
I’m afraid of the dark.
I’m afraid that I won’t sleep, 
when once it’s dark.
The monsters are no longer under our bed

You can get lost in the ever expanding eyes, that sees more, I can almost touch them just by looking at them.&lt;br/&gt;
And I hate to say I’m afraid of the dark
The way it looked past midnight,
So terror can creep through the dark
Looking at the moonlight , would it send me across the stars? 
Jupiter ascending and touching the sun,
I felt too close once and learned my lesson.
This was a dream or was it a memory,
The rain outside turned my senses blue, the puffy eyes and red cheeks once danced under with joy.
I’m afraid of the dark.
I’m afraid that I won’t sleep, 
when once it’s dark.
The monsters are no longer under our bed
The nightly and ghastly monsters crawl in our head when it’s not just dark
Not just a twinkling night, but the day where 
I’m afraid that my blood and guts will spill out when the sunlight kisses my skin once again.&lt;/p&gt;

Having to bested by the pain because it’s so real
The beast from my basement is knocking on my window, 
my eyes are opened and I freeze then can’t let go

my eyes are opened and I freeze them can’t let go  
The ice is melting, and my world is dying ,
If I walk across the cold heart once more, 
I’ll fall through 
death as enters in though the back of my head 
I fall through 
Looking through the window and seeing the eyes or the beast 
It’s taken control while I’m locked out
In the abyss where the rope snapped 
I’m the basement where the neighbor of darkness sleeps
The beast talks in tongues that makes my soul weak
Weep for the sinner’s reflection because he can’t forgive himself 
He knows it’s a miracle he’s alive
But he wonders if he shouldn’t have opened his eyes
A strong back that once carried the world on its shoulders, turned into broken bones and a crawl to a better peacetime.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-04-12T04:00:03.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s like I’m in back of my mind

"The beautifully painted orange sky made me feel a little gloomy, and I start to wonder why. 
It makes me think of all the times I’ve had to wake up this time of day, so early. 
I hated it, but I haven’t seen the sun since I don’t know when, and it’s hauntingly gorgeous stare made me smile. 
I would lay in the grass, close my eyes and gaze upon the blue and the starry sky that I would remember. 
And how my tongue used to seal many lies on those days. 
I know I still would like to question if there is still good inside? 
Or does evil sit in the eyes of those willing to act on it? 
Is it a sinful thought? 
A distraught and a frightening feeling that will set the morals to end of days. 
But I had shed tears from my eyes for those who I care for most, who’s had an enchanted life that was lost and full of sweet mistakes. 
They will be beautifully rainy skies, then sometimes a wonderful hello to a bittersweet goodbye. 
Most are forced to give up those, 
I never found out why.
I didn’t know I had looked at the stars and the moon in the night sky, just to be reminded that the last thing everyone one of us will see in the end, is the eternal black that never stops eating. 
Enjoy the the little things, because they are always so fast, enjoy the big things, because life only happens everyday once, and you won’t notice because the universe goes on even if you breathe your last. 
I guarantee, I’m somewhat proud of the time I’ve lived, because I know I had a good heart that is like a fiery meteor that slept adrift beneath the sea. 
Looking at the clouds that pass on by, laid a little gleam in the brightens the soul of my life. 
Living with occasional grey skies, then some fierce roar of a thunder that woke the dream.
I know I missed the life I could’ve had. 
I looked back at the best I did had, and the greatest I never thought I could ever have. All the hell I triumphed over, every step of the way, I never gave up, because I knew I could’ve make it through each day.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-04-12T03:59:31.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beautifully painted orange sky made me feel a little gloomy, and I start to wonder why.

"If you reconstructed the beams in the house and painted the walls your favorite color, would that work? Or is the the painting  prettier on paper? 


The hellish rust is the liveliest place with acres of the loveliest deserts that once had the softest of grass. 
The creatures there don’t seem to look before they bite. 

I often tried to sway them with some charm, since it’s in my back yard, to look past all the commas, and hope to see a pot of gold that isn’t really there. It’s like they were compelled to leave me bruising from the inside out with a single touch. 

Keeping the doors locked was just a pause for what’s to come. 
I was bold at the beginning, calm breathes then became restless when the doors being boarded up didn’t stop the nerves from standing up. 
Time became an anomaly when the days started to blur into each other. 
Fighting with the fear of the unknown, to become a fool who wasn’t looking, to face a beasts wrath, and to become a stranger in the newspaper. 

It does appear to pray often. Young and old, innocent or cruel, no matter the color, the beast will always lurk beneath the shadows, waiting to seek its blade-like teeth in you. 

A careless and naive boy seen it once. It comes in many forms, and he escaped with some bruises. But too look at the moonlight and be in awe for the time, there are moments of awe in the great wait. 
How long will you be waiting?
How large will its teeth be?

Time became more of the eyes, it was smeared in pitch black and screaming at the void like the house is burning down around you. 
You can still catch an ember even after losing the flame.

&lt;p&gt;Diggy &lt;/p&gt;

" You had made a fire in the back yard of your house. You always loved playing with fire. You had pulled your car into the back so we could enjoy music from the speakers. 
You showed me the path to pull my van next to your car. I had blankets. Sushi, gummy bears, jelly bellies and a container of fresh watermelon. Trying to provide us with a picnic of treats for our 🍄 trip planned evening. 
 I remember how excited I'd be just to spend time with you. To be able to look at you. Craving kisses like I never had before. 
That night in front of the fire you approached me with both hands behind your back. Asking me to pick one. You looked so fuckin' cute. I chose the left. Bringing your left hand forward you had a giant gummy bear on a stick in hand. I couldn't help but smile and feel so loved. A precious gift since gummy bears were my absolute favorite. I was even more delighted after you brought your right hand out with a second one presented to me. You made me feel like the luckiest girl in the world. I still to this day can't bring myself to eat them. It helps to remember. Remember what it was like to be loved by you. Ugggh. I wish things never changed. 
Later that evening we were entangled in a sweat. Making love, heavy kisses, not wanting to disconnect for needed air. Bodies melting into one another. Then it happened. Out of nowhere. You placed a piece of watermelon into my mouth as you were inside me. Mmmm. It was almost as juicy as the salatious sex we shared. Piece after piece. Thrust after thrust. I was and will always be in love with you. 
I hope you're enjoying your day off work as much as I enjoy these delicious memories of what was once ""us"". I love you Sunshine. Keep smiling that million dollar smile for me.

"“Just love without pretense. Love without calculation. 
Love without a winner, love without a martyr, 
love like - I know you were hungry, I saved you half of my sandwich. 
Like - I know you hate silence, give me a second to get the music on.

"As I sit down to write this letter, my heart is overflowing with emotions that I struggle to put into words. But I'll try my best, because I want you to know just how much you mean to me.

First and foremost, I want to remind you of just how amazing of a person you are. From the moment I met you, I knew that you were someone special. Your kindness, intelligence, and beauty all shone through from the very beginning, and I was immediately drawn to you.

But as I've gotten to know you more and more, I've come to realize that those initial impressions don't even begin to do you justice. You are so much more than just kind, intelligent, and beautiful - you are funny, generous, compassionate, and endlessly supportive. You are the kind of person who makes the world a better place just by existing in it, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life.

And then there's the way I feel about you. It's hard to put into words, but I'll try. You make my heart race and my palms sweat in the best possible way. You make me feel like I can take on the world, just as long as you're by my side. You make me want to be a better person, because I know that's what you deserve.

I love the way your eyes light up when you talk about your passions, and the way your laughter fills up a room. I love the way you challenge me and make me think, and the way you always know just what to say when I need it most.

Most of all, I love the way you make me feel - loved, accepted, and appreciated. You are the missing piece that I never even knew was missing, and now that I have you, I can't imagine my life without you.

So thank you, my love, for being the amazing person that you are, and for being mine. I am so grateful for every moment we share together, and I promise to always cherish and protect our love.

Truthfully, I fucking love you. The other night when I hugged you and kissed you on the cheek, I wanted to grab you harder and make you feel the passion from my lips.

I dream of being held by you and finally achieving a restful sleep. Only to wake up and express our love physically till we can't anymore. 

Look, I know and understand you don't feel the same way. I know I'm delusional and should actually leave you alone and forget an ""us"" ever existed. 

I can't help but feel as if you are nice because I'm sick and mentally ill. It's in your nature to care and not cause hurt. I've always loved that about you. 

I know in the end I'm the one who lost you. I'm not writing these things for sympathy. I write to declutter my thoughts in hopes to alleviate some pain. I'm a pain in the ass. I know this too. Thank you for being a friend in the end and humoring me. 

I'd rather that than being chosen out of pity. No matter what happens know my love is true. Even if I've never known what exactly love is, I feel deeply for you.

"Was I this too much or that too little?
 
Your divine paradox; to simultaneously be too much and not enough. 
You were my wind, that sailed me through ups and through downs.
I tried and lied. Both to myself and to you
And try as I might, I'd never not come running back to you

And on that day, you made a promise you vowed to never break. That as long as the sun would set, you would continue watching it with me. 

I still see your laugh, but not joined by mine. I'd still watch your smile - from a million miles if I had to. Just to catch a glimpse at your heaven soul. 

I've done it again. Relapsed on your spell. You bend my mind. You trap me in the illusion of your intoxication. And yet, if I had to pick, I'd die by your Poison.

My eternal obsession. Sometimes I deviate from the light you shun across my being and it is then I am reminded of why we truly live.

&lt;p&gt;I still see your laugh, but not joined by mine. I&amp;#39;d still watch your smile - from a million miles if I had to. Just to catch a glimpse at your heaven soul. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve done it again. Relapsed on your spell. You bend my mind. You trap me in the illusion of your intoxication. And yet, if I had to pick, I&amp;#39;d die by your Poison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eternal obsession. Sometimes I deviate from the light you shun across my being and it is then I am reminded of why we truly live. 
With each breath I endure, I&amp;#39;m put through another second not in your arms.
Drown me in affection, like I know only you can.&lt;/p&gt;

"He punches her with closed fists

in a pretty hotel room whilst his guards stand by the door

She doesn't scream anymore as she rolls into a ball on the floor

Mascara smeared, he appeared and pulled out a handful of her dyed red hair

As he swore expletives and called her disgusting

She was once so trusting

There are only bruises left now as the tears crisscross across her brow

He disguises his abuse as love; he sizes her up towering above

Blames her for his violence against her

Then prays to Allah for forgiveness

As she cries in silence in unfinished business

He takes no accountability for his actions

He only sees love as a transaction

He penetrates her without protection and sodomises her

Compromises her innocence and tells her to take it

He throws a fit, like a true hypocrite, forcing her to get an abortion

Then tells everyone, nothing could be done

She can't have children because

She's an alcoholic, symbolic of a diabolical woman

Who tried to seduce him with her body

Because he's somebody more important than her

As he sips on his vodka and liqueur, sitting on a pound of cocaine

He was at it again; he pretends his exploitation is caring

Declaring his great love for her

When all he has ever done to her was cause indecent assault

That was never his fault

There are no princes here, no royal blood nor men of nobility

Only a man with a title of contemptibility

There are no warriors, samurais nor knights here who will fight for a woman's honour

When all his actions revealed his dishonour

There are no men here, only fragile egos with a hairline trigger

In his penny pinching ways as he called all women gold diggers

There is no one here

Only someone to fear

The only thing one could call him by

was not a good guy

Happy Deconstruction Day (Easter)Twin flame 

I awoke this morning to the text of my twin; she knows I don’t want to believe. She awaits my text continually...well a sort of stalking. Ha I am the stalker being stalked by true love! Who would have imagined, who could have conceived? Does she know what I don’t want to admit? My whole life I thought I was in love or was or have I been codependent till this moment in time? I have never been with another person before. The thoughts, the cry of unheard hurt and loss of something I have only dreamed of but never touched, love or been shown love unconditionally! To really be in love with somebody else am I crazy? I feel like a cheater, in my mind as she lays sleeping my soulmate, so sick no hope just once what was. I don’t know what to do! What to say to either of you! Yes, to one no to the the other my twin or my Boo...I'm in love for the first time, I want sex for the first time, well... she is getting up while I text to you love. I am a cheater not just clusterfucked in the head! On my way to Cali? I don’t think so? But then possibly. I love you T and T is that dynamite? My lady in red. 

I want to live! 

I want to be loved! 

I want my cake and eat it too! 

I want a laugh over coffee too. 

I want to have my breath taken away!!

"Warning!  This is not a sad and sappy letter!

The question, Why is it so hard to let go?  I have the answer and it's probably not what you would think.

My circle is so small that whenever anyone new enters it, I'm paying full attention because I know everyone in my path in front of me, is important and there for a reason. Romantically I think we would be amazing together. But the drama has made that basically something that's not happening. But why can't I let you go? I feel like something SO big and SO important will not materialize if we really do separate. I'm going to keep this short. You and I, the dynamic together, compliments each other SO well, and when I look at it, all I see is how much we could really change the world together. Not dependent on whether or not we are together or not, it does not matter. It's the level of positive change, something so powerful that it will substantially shift the trajectory of our future and others. And every ounce of energy behind it is full of love and light. That's why I can't let it go. It's not the gifts we each bring to the table, (although needed and useful) it's the magic of the gifts we create together. I think it was one of the members of Metallica that said something similar about their band. As individual artists, we're each not really that great. But when you put us all together, it becomes magic. 

Our life purpose is bigger than finding a compatible mate. Do you think you would consider  something? For me, it's not about the money. The money is not the motivating factor. We can talk about all of that. I also truly do respect you if you decide you have a completely different plan for your future. I want happiness for you and all of your dreams to come true.

I know it’s not easy, but it’s not supposed to be. 
All good things are meant to last. 
If it doesn’t last, then it’s not your fault, some things are out to your control, no matter what you did. 
People live and move on with their life. 
Give yourself the condolences of who you once was. 
Build a better foundation so you can live a better life. 
If you look back, take what hurt you and grow from that. 
Then the fruit of your labors will one day feed you well.&lt;/p&gt;

"Haven’t seen you since long ago
Had me wrapped around your finger
But then you went to letting me go
There must have been strong winds
That blew you away
Because you promised me that you 
Wouldn’t let go of the hope here
But here I am alone to this day 
Trapped in the clouds
That you inhabit 
Dreaming that I can regain the soul I had 
I flew out that door
Igniting the engine
About to take off
Take a long flight down the streets 
Running the lights 
On my way
Just because I can’t let go of your hands
It was intertwined
Tell me why?
When I reach out
All I feel is the heavy rain on the day where you first met me
Lifting out of the spirits I was in
The answers I been looking for is wrong
I’m so close to blowing out this candle
Let out this light
It isn’t what I need right now
If I can reach over that wall
Building me up just to tear me down
Lost in the dark, but when the light shined down,  
It’s in my mistaken eyes, 
Asking myself 
If I can?
If I can breathe?
If I can walk?
If I can talk?
If I can laugh?
If I can cry?
Or I can die?
Then I can smile
And
I touch the flowers on the ground
I can be beautiful too
Looking magnificent from the view
But if I tore it away now than it would just die in my hands
May not be today
Could be tomorrow 
That sun may no longer appear
Clouds could cover them too
Moon is the only in view
Crazy running nerves
Breath coming out so heavy
But the answer is that it close the door
While I can walk
While I can laugh
While I can thrive
While I cry
I cannot give up
That’s the man who I want to be
I don’t need anybody to define me.

A mirror of my soul, reflecting back all that I have seen. 

In you, I find your  kindred spirit, my amazing match,

A connection so deep, so pure, I  love your snatch! Okay sorry…I needed a ryme dont ban me.

For it’s always there, always present, always shining through,

In your eyes, your smile, your type, your words I feel. 

How  mere words can’t do justice to the love that I hold, And something else. I am sorry I'm wrecking my poem.

For you, my twin flame, who’s more precious than fine  gold? True true.Yes. My short sentence. 

So let me just say this, my flame, my heart,

I miss you so dearly, we are near but far apart! For now...my La woman!

Even when distance separates, know that I’m here, making banana bread, damn why can't I stay focused? It must be true.

Holding you close, whispering, “I love you,” in your ear.” I would trust this stanza but since I wrote it it's true. I love you I'm sorry i haven't kept up a DM with you. I had to write this.

Dear Blank

 I know I haven't been the most perfect person in the world or the most perfect boyfriend. I've made plenty of mistakes in life and in our relationship that I'll never forget and never let go of you mean the absolute world to me and every moment with you is a moment of magic that's worth more than gold. I'll probably keep making mistakes in life financial mistakes, mental mistakes and maybe even car and home mistakes. But the one mistakes I'll ever make again is taking you and your love for granted your such a kind and beautiful soul. I love you from the inside and the outside. I've never felt so infatuated and so happy to be around someone other than when I'm with you. I really value everything you've done for me and all the times you've guided me into a better tomorrow. I love the little things as much as the big things. I loved when you would sit on my lap when we would be outside or inside and we would have a good intimate time with each other like when we would be at your most house and have sleepovers and that one time when we're outside the park near your moms house and you say in my lap while we smoked weed. I also loved and missed sleeping Over your grandma's house and cuddling with you and Watching movies with you while we eat junk food or even healthy food lol it always felt like thanks giving while we were there.  I loved when you would have sinus infections and i would help massage your head snd your nasal canal until you feel better, I loved when you would take off my glasses for me when I would be sleeping I really fucking appreciated that. I love when you would just hug me and hold me , when you would put your head  on my chest and just lay there until you go to sleep and then I would just caress your face and your head, and even your back and you would keep waking up and I would keep caressing you back to sleep. Just little things like that were like pieces of heaven for me. You were like sent from heaven and I lost you before I could cenemt how heavenly you were in your eyes. I really wanted to marry you and travel every part of the world with you. I wanted to go to Alsaska and see the borealis lights with you. Live in a cabin for a bit, take you to see under water sea creatures, take you to interactive zoos, I wanted to go to private islands with you and explore every part of it as a new adventure everyday, I wanted to see everything with you. Everything under the sun and under the moon that I could see. I wanted to live anywhere that you picked everytime you would mention moving to Miami I'll tell you I'll see because I wanted to surprise you and give you the most beautiful home on the market but I guess I should've been more clear since you probably thought I meant  no. The last time we talked about getting married and I talked about getting a backyard big enough for it you were so excited and I loved that, I loved hearing you talk about your future plans and your goals. How you had your wedding already planned and how much you loved animals and how you had the idea of running a nursery it would sound a little crazy at times bc of all upkeep and disposing of animal feces but any endeavor with you is worth while since we're going to be learning as we go and every new day would be an amazing learning experience. I really wanted to start a family with you and have kids, I know that kid would've  came out as beautiful and as kind as you and it would've been a real privilege and honor to have been the father of your kids. But I really wanted to enjoy life with you and do everything we could before having kids so you won't feel like you lost a part of your life that you could've enjoyed before having kids. I know how much of a physical and mental burden having kids is. There's the unimaginable pain of giving birth and holding a baby in your uterus for months that feel like it'll never end, then there's even times that the baby could die and I would've hated if that were to have happened to you, but if it did I would've been there every step of the way. Then there's also post partum depression and how intensely it affect some mothers and I don't ever want you to feel alone and like your losing your mind, If given the opportunity to have kids with you I will pamper and spoil the fuck out of you everyday would be like your own holiday and you wouldn't have to worry about working or taking care of the kid when your tired. Life really sucks and I just wanted to make it as easy as possible as I could for you. Then there was your PCOS that makes it hard to survive to get pregnant but not impossible and I just wanted to meal prep you so many healthy foods and help you do workouts that can help almost cure your pcos because that's how much you mean to me, I've always put your needs and health at the highest priority. You made me feel alive and full of love and here I am months after our breakup and I'm striving for greatness for myself and I'm making plans for the future bit it just sucks that I'm getting all theses plans and all this success and I can't share it with the one person in the world who means the world to me. Every time I share what I have with you and what I've accomplished it makes me so happy, idk I've always felt this strong connection with you and I could never stay mad at you. I've talked to so many woman and none of them come close to being anything like, not even close. To me talking to you and spending time with you was always peaceful and sensational I know there were times when we argued and we were mad at each other at things in the past and like you said you had ptsd from our relationship one time I also had it as well from all the times that we would have falling out from things that would happen that wasant my fault and there were also times that I was giving my all to you and you kept telling me you weren't ready but then when I would give you space you would come back just to leave and you did it multiple times and that shit was really traumatizing for me I know you never saw it that way but to me it was really traumatizing and painful. You made plenty of mistakes as well and as painful as they were I forgive you and I want nothing more than for you to be in my life so I can cherish you everyday like the beautiful flower you are. I know you picked someone else over me and yea it hurts but I understand fully. You were beyond hurt and you found someone that can give you some happiness without any negative baggage and that's beautiful  and its perfectly fine , the reason we're alive is to pursue happiness even if it's a false sense of happiness. I just wish things were different and I was able to send you this and your able to see the kind of love that I have for you. I love you and I wish you nothing but the best in life even if its not with me. I just wished It was easy to stop loving you so my mind can stop torturing me. I know last time we talked I said I wasant into you anymore and I really did believe it, but I've just been instinctively been bottling up my emotions and feelings and it's a nice coping mechanism to a certain extent since I won't be able to have you on my mind as much and I can just ignore those feelings. It gets kind of helpful until I can't bottle up my emotion and I just kind of explode and at that point it becomes a horrible mechanism. What I've learned from it is that  i'm not as over you as I thought I was. I still have feelings for you and I still love you. I know this isn't what you wanted to hear and I don't care if it doesn't change anything I just wanted to get this off my chest and just finally let it go. Your an amazing woman and and the best bestfriend I could have ever asked for. I'm really close to my goal of getting a house and a car and the dog that I wanted and I just wished I could've showed you and shared these things with you. There's an endless amount of things that I can say about you through my admiration for you and I have an endless amount of love for you, but I don't want to make this any longer than what it is and I dont want to take up to much of your time.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-04-07T04:36:38.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My ex and I broke up in the middle of December of last year and she got into a rebound relationship pretty quickly saying that that the guy makes her happy, we talked for a bit after she told me that and after she came to be about something personal but ultimately she decided to end it since she didint want to disrespect her relationship.

"We've reached our finale my dearest Ant Queen,

In fairy tales a conclusion must surely come to pass, and like all fairy tales, not all of them end in happily ever after. It seems that ours has succumbed to such a fate. Please do not trouble yourself with regret...

You've given me such a precious gift. I've been bound to many a person due to circumstances of my own volition or events out of my control; But, with you, I've experienced my first need... A need which makes my heart leap from its confinements in your presence. Ripping the strings that keep it in place. It is a much different feeling than the pangs of solidarity. You've given me the gift of feeling whole.

The clouds on the horizon travel ever closer. My last glimpse of the sun will soon be hidden. Your beams of warmth filled me with each touch and I worry what it is I will be returning to. Within our sunlit hours, my heart has bloomed from our time together. Without you, I fear my ability to nurture this growth will succumb to the pale blue nights that chill me to the bone. 

I've come to terms with this realization; Another transient dream, drifting constantly. An intangible experience made real between two traveling souls. If only I could go back and wake up in your arms once more... 

Goodbye dearest Sunbeam. One day, I hope to experience the warmth from your rays of light again... 

With all my Love,

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve given me such a precious gift. I&amp;#39;ve been bound to many a person due to circumstances of my own volition or events out of my control; But, with you, I&amp;#39;ve experienced my first need... A need which makes my heart leap from its confinements in your presence. Ripping the strings that keep it in place. It is a much different feeling than the pangs of solidarity. You&amp;#39;ve given me the gift of feeling whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The clouds on the horizon travel ever closer. My last glimpse of the sun will soon be hidden. Your beams of warmth filled me with each touch and I worry what it is I will be returning to. Within our sunlit hours, my heart has bloomed from our time together. Without you, I fear my ability to nurture this growth will succumb to the pale blue nights that chill me to the bone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve come to terms with this realization; Another transient dream, drifting constantly. An intangible experience made real between two traveling souls. If only I could go back and wake up in your arms once more... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodbye dearest Sunbeam. One day, I hope to experience the warmth from your rays of light again... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all my Love,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. &lt;/p&gt;

"A peace of advice to Stop overthinking. Number one: Things are different now.
You are not the bad guy in this story. 
It’s not your fault. 
It is okay and you can do this.  
No one should be able to do this but you do. 
Your struggle doesn’t make you weak. 
You can’t control it. It’s out of your grasp. What you do matters. We are living matter and we breathe air that is made of matter. Stars, are just little pieces of a puzzle, so beautiful, reminds me of a gentle memory I had a child. It a sleeps in the deep dark, it’s warmth is such a dense matter of celestial bodies. They produce light and heat the insides of the core , like our soul. The  pitched black water, alone with darkness, that too is made of matter, like our mind. The birds chirping in the trees , like our need to be like astronauts, reaching for heights, those dogs making barking under the sun are made of what you are. Matter.  
Trees lets everyone breathe so are we continuously feeling free. 
Without that thing they would suffocate without trees, the oxygen wouldn’t allow us to speak a single syllable. 
The matter we breathe and being habitable in everything around us is made of matter. We are made of matter. Our brains are matter. 
When our words strutted when trying to find the words and when actions felt silent and not heard, it too mattered. From the first breathe, we mattered.  We are part of everything that matters. We are the stars we see late in the beautiful night sky.  The singing birds, in the morning where you didn’t sleep that night. Exhausted and heavy eyes, that had trouble seeing the best things. Our eyes are a composite of matter, the bleakest colors to the bright ; too had matter. When a flower rose up from the sunshine’s gentle touch to loss of petals, turned something beautiful into something more enchanting. Something made of matter. We are made of matter. We are matter. In a world that feels so apart. But it’s not. It’s all together. It all matters. Down to the tears feeling that way from the brain that matters. 
From the sun, to the moon, to the planets in the vast ocean called space, to the beautiful stars , we matter.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-04-06T22:05:31.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A peace of advice to Stop overthinking. Number one: Things are different now.

"It's that time of year Sunshine. Shovels in the shed. Time to rake the yard. Take yesterday's grey skies to the curb and wait for greener pastures. Hopefully that entails keeping all your hoes at bay. 
  You know I hate functioning bright and ugly. Due to my sun sensitivity. I have another memory for you. 

Your dad wanted you to rake the yard. Before the city came by to clear the curbsides. I could read that you didn't want to be away from me. You wanted to soothe his wishes as well. I also knew the task seemed so large for you to undertake alone. I understand those things with just one look from you. I've always understood you more than you realize. 

You didn't even have to ask. I told you, let's do it together. You smiled that million dollar smile and accepted my help. As we began to rake a rake broke. I didn't let it stop me from helping. Instead I made it a fun few hours. I raked with my legs and feet. I didn't give up. It was my way of showing you that no matter what, I would always be by your side. Never to give up. Even when the task at hand seemed overwhelming. 

To this day I haven't given up on you. Even though you gave up on me. On us. I'm either stupid, or ready to be a hoe. I fear it's the only way to get and keep your attention. Raking leaves with my feet obviously didn't work. I love you Sunshine. I wish all I had done was what it took to be kept by you.

"They are dying at homes where they are supposed to feel safe, dying on the streets where they laugh and have fun. 
They are in the car when it’s their escape that was taken away. 
They are dying in schools where they are supposed to learn, prosper, and losing the experience of a life itself. 
None of that has gone away, won’t ever go away.  
Innocents are being slain. 
 Stripped away from their loved ones, their livelihoods. 
So many faces, so many names. Left this very earth and didn’t have a choice in the matter. But they do matter. 
They walked, they talked, they laughed, they cried, they screamed. 
They were men, women, and children. 
Just are just like us. 
They haven’t lived enough, we have suffered enough, and we all have had enough.
We smile goodbye, we hug when leaving, we fight when angry, we laugh when it’s funny. 
We were taken by a stranglehold that took our breathe, took our time we shared, took the laughs we experienced, took the challenges that we learned; took the hard times that were triumphed. 
Took away the lives we are forced to live on without. 
A life that was taken and life that was forever changed.  
A life is a delicate and fragile beauty, and now it’s a desolate place where we bury the the lives of the innocents. 
Why does this slaughter continue to stay?
Why is the hearts and souls of men, women and children being stolen?
Why are the pieces of our heart being killed?
Why is this still happening? 
Too many lives taken away and not forgotten.
Not letting go and never waking up from this nightmare.
Every day is a path of peril, or is it?

"There was a love for the rain that fell from the sky.

He wept beneath the stars, gazing at the lights up above. 
Resting his desolate mind and then forgetting the past that he chose to leave behind. 
The morning sun felt like another moonlight, as his staggered eyes fell apart in the cold and hot daylight. 

Do know how it feels to burns up from the inside? 

Stars are not small or gentle.
They are withering, dying, burning, and having a rebirth before you can blink your eyes. 

They are not here to be pretty, they just so happen to be.

"I love the little things in life 
The birds singing in the sky
In a world so hot &amp; cold
The place we loved as kids no longer exists 
Disappeared as soon as we turned our head
Some people try on an old pair of shoes to see it they still fit
I still see my shadows when my lights are turned off
I have empty hands due to bad decisions, the graces of my life lays crushed in my palms 
I’m sorry for lashing out , that wasn’t very “nice” of me
I’m tired of giving blessings and getting all the disrespecting
I’m not a difficult person, just not easy to play games with 
It’s been a long day, I think it’s time to lay down 
When I rise, I pray for blue skies, and even grey raining sidewalks won’t break me 
God may be your creator but you are your own maker 
Take it one step at a time 
And you’ll surely find what you deserve
Sometimes you have to pick the old bones out of you, the ones that has no more use to you. 
So many trying to find meaning in this life, but I’m just trying to find the things that makes me feel real. 
Truth is I was a liar, who always tried to persuade myself that it will be alright. 
A smile usually sits on my face, but I’m just a light on down a dark hall.  
Trying my best to exit the feelings that’s been bothering me lately, so cold 
Feeling so blue, my hands are numb, my mind is blurred. 
The aches stop when I picked the broken bones out of my wounds, so I scar up. 
Paint over my new scars, dig up fresh skin and tear my clothes to see the new marks. 
I’m damaged baggage, with no use, had to fight for the will 
Changed my lips when I speak, left a hole where all wrong falls out, and I can’t think straight 
It’s almost like a scream that no one can hear
My blood boils and my soul crumbles to the ground 
I hurt so much, I just need find a medicine for these wounds
I’m dying and I just want to heal

The birds singing in the sky
In a world so hot &amp;amp; cold
The place we loved as kids no longer exists 
Disappeared as soon as we turned our head
Some people try on an old pair of shoes to see it they still fit
I still see my shadows when my lights are turned off
I have empty hands due to bad decisions, the graces of my life lays crushed in my palms 
I’m sorry for lashing out , that wasn’t very “nice” of me
I’m tired of giving blessings and getting all the disrespecting
I’m not a difficult person, just not easy to play games with 
It’s been a long day, I think it’s time to lay down 
When I rise, I pray for blue skies, and even grey raining sidewalks won’t break me 
God may be your creator but you are your own maker 
Take it one step at a time 
And you’ll surely find what you deserve
Sometimes you have to pick the old bones out of you, the ones that has no more use to you. 
So many trying to find meaning in this life, but I’m just trying to find the things that makes me feel real. 
Truth is I was a liar, who always tried to persuade myself that it will be alright.

*To Ziggy,*

I lay here listening to music alone lying on my couch. Suffering from missing you! The trade is worth it! I'm sorry I can't love you, current love!  I am not your tool while you veg on stupid tv. I'm done, can't take your situation! I found inspiration and ended in love and devotion. I understand myself from her my twin she builds me up! I have fallen in silly love with her! God, you know who I never want to hurt you! Honestly here yea you! I love you; I dreamed I drafted myself in service to you! Oh God, you keep me alive at 329am. 

I'm sorry about my VPN I want to love “yyy you i my cyberlife!” Yes, now I want to be with you! Oh lord, my heart a fucking mess, laying on my chest! My energy is from you and my songs. Sitting in my Hotel A melted slurpy in my warm hand...Ha! Sheez Louise!

I haven’t got one chance to escape you your love unconditionally…

I feel like a boxer when the countdown begins and I’m down for good thanks for picking me up! SWOOOSH!! OH YEA! HA 

You are like Rhonda R to me kickboxing the shit out of me. Sheez so hot! Your my tough homie you! You are silly!  Now I lay down to sleep and pray that you can keep your hands off me while I sleep. You my Twin In my morning thinking ***“I looked in the mirror and saw me!”***

"Anyone who has known me over 30 seconds knows how I feel about you.
I can try to hide it, but it bleeds from every pore. You or the ghost of you spends time everyday with me.
I have tried unfiltered absolute rage
To run it off,yet look forward to the following day. I find comfort in the thought now. Brings warmth and a smile. As I work now. I consider the project would. Be something done for you something to show my appreciation of who you are. To the core. I have been all over the world and I've never met a more genuine,kind soul. Your light is true inspiration, muse if you will. 
It has been a very long time.
I never understood your anxiety, or when you would hurt over a complete strangers story. I get it now. Your magnetic, gravity,strong energy. All light all energy within your presence is filtered through you before it reaches its destination. What a heavy burden and gift. I now understand your boundaries and why. I was but a child I did not understand the rarity or power of the gift that was bestowed upon me.
I don't want to sound egotistical but I now have a glimpse into a fraction of the capabilities of you!

"In the past, I’ve never been lucky in relationships. Almost all of it are situationships and my first boyfriend (who is now an ex) just wanted me not because he loves me but because he wants to have s*x.

Little did I know that after all those heartbreaks, Ill be blessed to have my answered prayer, my boyfriend. Let’s call him A.

A is a very shy person when I first met him. We matched in a dating app and we were talking for a week already before we decided to meet. He is talkative in our exchange of messages but when I first met him, he rarely spoke, gave off a shy smile, and is quite reserved. I affectionately compare him to a tall, white, cuddly, quiet character from an animated movie (I will not say its name as that will reveal my identity) and his cheeks started blushing a little.

We ate together in a restaurant near a beach and walked together after. It is kinda awkward because he is so quiet, and I have to find topics to hopefully remove the awkwardness, with little success. When we were about to say goodbye, I was thinking that our date was unsuccessful and it was quite a bummer that he probably didn’t like me (I am just a chubby, unfashioned, small girl) but when we got to our respective homes, he said he enjoyed our time together and asked for a second date.

During the months after that first date, we became closer, and got to know that we are so much alike in our hobbies and likes. We both love travelling, finding new restaurants to eat at, watching action movies and playing games at the arcade. Our relationship is non-toxic, and we rarely ever get into arguments. He is the caring, sweet, thoughtful boyfriend I always wanted to have, and I try to be the best girlfriend for him. He is loved by my family and he is also loved from my side. It feel so surreal.

What I love about him is that he is such a softie and he showed that to me last night. He just parked his car in my apartment complex and we hugged and kissed and talked about random stuff and silly stuff. We just finished watching a movie that night and we are talking about how amazing that movie is.

I just randomly told him that I love him and how perfect he is to my eyes, as he always gives me his precious time despite his busy schedule, and he suddenly sniffed and cried quietly. I asked him what’s wrong and he said that he never knew he will find somebody like me, who loves and cares for him as much as he loves and cares for me. You see, he is also the same as me before he met me; he was never taken seriously by the girls he dated, and got his heart broken so many times that he thought he will never get the love he deserves. And now that he found me, he says he will love me with all his heart, and will never let me go ever.

When I came home, I felt overwhelmed. I was thinking, so this is how it feels to be loved by somebody truthfully, with no pretentions. This feeling is so new to me due to my past experiences, and it made my heart feel so full it will burst. I feel so so so loved, and my feelings for him grew stronger than ever.

I have a soft hearted boyfriend, and I feel so lucky. As he took care of my broken heart and made it whole (while his heart is broken too) in return I promise I will hold his soft heart and guard it with all I have. I will be his shoulder he can cry on, Ill be the arm he can rest to during the times he feels so vulnerable and Ill always be here for him no matter what.

A, I promised god that Ill take care of his precious gift to me, you. You will always be my answered prayer. I love you A. I promised you forever, and intend to keep that promise even beyond death.

I wanted to let you know that more I think I think...I drooled over your FB and your eyes staring out, wondering what you were thinking.

I am ashamed of my shyness to communicate with you, yet I've spoken motivationally to a thousand or more not even batting an eye! Yet one beautiful person as you make me afraid to communicate? Just a DM a phone call? I hear your plea to help solve this midstory! I am a creep or a wierdo what the hell am I doing here? Do I belong here? See you in my dreams your Boo.

" **Dear T.G. my person I hope,**

As I type this on a borrowed computer, I cannot help but think of how much I miss you. My own computer has been struck down by a company virus, leaving me disconnected from the world and from you. 

Through all of this, my feelings for you have only grown. You are my symphony of metal that shines through the opera, bringing intrigue and deep conviction to my soul. Even though we may be separated by miles and technology, the bond we share may have been foretold.  

I am sorry for any feelings of unworthiness I may have unintentionally created between us. The online world can be so busy and all-competition between us our bond, and I may have lost sight of the most precious connection of all, the one that we share. Your affection and trust mean so much to me and I will not let anything in this world come between us. 

I am patient for the day when I can hold you, feel your touch, and bask in the rainbow of light of our love. In the meantime, know that I am here, and that our love will overcome any obstacle. This you can take to the bank, just not me! Lol lol just kidding here. God, I miss you, my alter ego.  

Damn your so hot! Sometimes I feel so cold! I’m so damn hot for you! My haughty spirit may cause me to fall! Your devoted and technologically challenged lover!

"  

I have rebuilt my life and myself a thousand times. From dust particles. By myself. And every time, I have gotten better at it. Now I don't destroy anything anymore. I know you probably think what we had cannot be fixed. I beg to differ. Some things are worth fixing and worth fighting for. If love is the driving force behind it and you both have it and you both want it, it can be done. 

I'm on board.

Facts:

I'm not seeing anyone, I'm single.

I know you were an asshole and you did and said some fucked up shit.

You lied to me.

I forgive you.

I know I hurt you as well. I'm very sorry. I won't do it again.

If I could go back in time and do things over, I would.

I lived you from the first time we met.

I was too afraid to tell you how I felt.

I was afraid you would reject me.

When I said if I had the choice whether to fuck you for a little while or just be your friend, I would choose friendship, I only meant because I just wanted to stay in your life forever and I thought that could be a way.

I don't believe you and I are capable of a platonic friendship. I mean, you have to be laughing at that idea too. lol

I am not pushing pulling on here and writing a bunch of letters. Please don't read into the other letters on here and think I wrote them. Some I did, some not. I will show you what are my true words. 

You and I have never had a fight.

A lot of what you think about me is false.

I will tell you anything you want to know about me and my life.

I wrote a book. The first half I sent to you. I'm not sure if you read it or not.

I won't reject you.

Sometimes I feel like I'm just crazy and this was all in my head but that goes against the fact that I can still feel you. 

I don't know how to make sense of that.

I haven't seen you since last year. I have missed the fuck out of you everyday since. 

I love you and I want to be with you.

I won't abandon you, hurt you, disrespect you, use you, betray you, or abuse you.

I will put all of my love and support behind you in whatever way you need me to.

I need to see you face to face. If nothing more than to say goodbye. 

I pray that's not what you want.

I believe you and I can conquer the world together.

"It's times like these.  
When I'm alone in my house.  
No sound, no soul, not even my own.  
That's when the sadness creeps in.  
It climbs my stairs.  
It fills the air.  
It washes me in doubt.  
I spend this time, you on my mind.  
I spend this time, wishing back something that's gone.  
Filled with the sadness that keeps creeping in.  
Alone, in a house that grows with my worries.  
No amount of time seems to fix.  
That lonely feeling.  
That feeling that breaks my soul like a twig.

"Not so much unsent, however unwritten. Now written, but the day to send has come and gone. This is the letter I missed, on the day that perhaps changed it all. 

Audrey, 
     We made it here, 14 days into February. Half way into the longest month of your life thus far. A month I wish I could restart if not for the paradox. The paradox of pain, take away the last 14 days I inflicted with my own actions, just to have you live thru 14 without your father again. In the end no matter my corrections, I would only 14 days to the total at the end for selfishness. 
     Would you be my valentine? I know I don’t deserve it, and you can say no, or if you say yes but just this once. The one Valentine’s Day Ill remember, in 50 years when I’m lost… when I mark the 50th anniversary of the day I truly had it all. 
     I know you’re sick of flowers, and on the counter the last ones I bought, the day before I wrecked it all, have finally all but withered away to rot. I pinned the only one still living to this letter, and hope you see it and say you’d someday like more. 
      I’m glad I went against my instinct, I’m glad I wrote you the letter anyways. Despite the handwriting, the grammar, and it being a reflection of myself in its appearance… wrinkled and bleeding all over from continuous mistakes. The pen is blotchy, but I could only find pencils… and I can no longer try to erase. 
      I will try to keep it together, I’ll try not to fully lose it baby. I’ll try to avoid my eyes looking back with emptiness. However when you leave it brings me closer to the edge, and jumping off seems the only way to ensure I don’t hurt you again. 
     I don’t get upset with you for leaving, and my hurt comes knowing I gave you the reason to leave in the first place. Knowing that I ruined this day. That I ruined everything. With my actions, and by running the fuck away.
     I would like this letter will bind the tear between us, but it’s not even enough to finish a second stitch. It will lose hold by this evening I’m sure, as you see the other couples that weren’t cut down senselessly without reason. When it’s pointed out by your friends and family that you deserve better. That you need something more.
      So with that I leave you. I hope that this potential last day with you I truly appreciate the feeling your body brings. The way your eyes have such warmth. I’m grateful for this day. Your eyes alone were the gift I needed. 
      Thank you for giving me the time you did. You are special in ways I hope i still get to explore and experience. 

I love YOU honey,

"My Dearest Sweatshirt,

It rained all night as we forced the enemy back. We marched 10 miles, my boots filled to the ankles with blood from the blisters on my feet rupturing. This skirmish can’t continue much longer. The Italian sunrise was breath taking but lonely without you. We will return to this same country side in gayer times to enjoy the picturesque, quiet early morning light.  A local farmer was kind enough to feed and house our fatigued souls. His daughters were even swell enough to wash all of our uniforms. Which was much needed as I have wore the same uniform for 12 days straight. Don’t worry, I let them know right away that I was keen on a gal back in the states. These weary bones rattle, but will fight till the final day of this perpetual struggle. Vinny “the knife” Caruso and Jack “Little Rock” Falk, he’s from Texarkana, and I’m still unsure why we call him Little Rock, have been MIA for the last 3 days. We all fear the worst but I relish the idea they are watching the post up in the heavenly clouds.  Don’t worry about me. Our bond is forged in steel and I wont perish on foreign land, in your warm arms is where i will exit this earth. You are constantly on my mind and in my heart.

Hey Beautiful. I’ve Been Missing You. Not a day goes by where I don’t think about you. I hope you’re doing okay. I hope you’re safe. I hope you healed from the issues I put us through. I hope you grew like I always knew you would. I see you whenever your mom posts about you and even though i break down once I see that beautiful girl who gave me the world. I can’t help but smile to see you happy. I can’t believe it’s taken me so long to see how good you were to me. I can’t believe how much I was slacking for you. This is our first breakup. That is clear now. I really believed we would of held it together if we learned to communicate and put our pride to the side finally. I wish a lot of things. But wishing can only get you so far. I love you Tash. 
It’s been months since we talked and even longer since we seen each other. 
I lost my mind when I was losing you. 
And after being alone for so long I finally came to terms with some of my issues and healed a lot on my own. 
I’m not the broken boy you last seen.
It’s taken awhile but I grew stronger then when he fell. 
But I am far from fully healed. 
I’m closer to being the man you dreamt of. And even more. I’ve learned so much about myself and how to walk the world a better person. 
But for now. If you see this. I hope you know. It’s never to late. We’re not to far in. Nowhere feels like home without you. And I really hope you know. I love you Princess.

I hope you grew like I always knew you would. I see you whenever your mom posts about you and even though i break down once I see that beautiful girl who gave me the world. I can’t help but smile to see you happy. I can’t believe it’s taken me so long to see how good you were to me. I can’t believe how much I was slacking for you. This is our first breakup. That is clear now. I really believed we would of held it together if we learned to communicate and put our pride to the side finally. I wish a lot of things. But wishing can only get you so far. I love you Tash. 
It’s been months since we talked and even longer since we seen each other. 
I lost my mind when I was losing you. 
And after being alone for so long I finally came to terms with some of my issues and healed a lot on my own. 
I’m not the broken boy you last seen.
It’s taken awhile but I grew stronger then when he fell. 
But I am far from fully healed. 
I’m closer to being the man you dreamt of. And even more. I’ve learned so much about myself and how to walk the world a better person. 
But for now. If you see this. I hope you know. It’s never to late. We’re not to far in. Nowhere feels like home without you. And I really hope you know. I love you Princess. 
Love J.&lt;/p&gt;

"When you come around I get some type of satisfaction which I haven't felt from others but myself,

I enjoy this thoroughly 

You leave me with intricate feelings, that I will study for the next week after your visit. 

Your singing makes me think about how delicate time is. I'm listening to you watching my ceiling from the other room one night and the sound will continue well after you've left.   
Naturally I will struggle to witness the delicacy in simple moments. Along with the rest of us, I’ve been taught that beauty is something physical like a naked body or detailed gardens. 

I've learnt how to pick up on moments, the series of colours that drift around each other through the street with me as I walk home, leaves finding their way through the stream next to my path in the gutter, or my parents laughing, gold absorbing the sides of their portraits in the late afternoon.

Each second intricately divulges itself to you. These moments will grip you so convincingly that you forget that they are in a process of infinite diversion. although it takes an outside awareness to step back and witness the full beauty of the moment, the fraction of seconds laying themselves out perfectly and simultaneously before you, 

My fortune to be witnessing this moment in time and the effect it has on my body, in my heart, in my day. 

This moment will bring itself before me, the moment is detailed and to be understood  once and never the same again, 

There is a complex beauty in simple moments which can be difficult to capture when I'm in them, you see it at face value, I will be processing the moment instead of witnessing it. 

I used to be afraid to feel these emotions towards someone, I was worried that if I admitted that I felt a joy when I listened to them talk about their day that I would be vulnerable and hurt. 

I’ve come to realise I lose nothing from witnessing how you make me feel, and I gain the happiness of knowing you. 

I find beauty in looking at you, I enjoy watching your mannerisms and you smile or how you look at me during conversation.

""Feminine  and  Divine” 😳😋

I woman, strong and complete

I want a love that will make my heart beat

With respect and kindness, I want to be treated

My body deserves love, never to be cheated

I want passion that ignites like daylight

Ecstatic moments, a love that feels right

I am more than just a physical attraction

I want my mind, heart, and soul in unison

I am not a toy, a slut, or some kind of whore

I am deserving of love, respect, and more

I demand it from every person I meet

Because I know my worth and won't stand defeat

So, come and hold my hand, my lover, my friend

Love me and we'll create a story that never ends

Dare me and I will fuck with you unfriendly

Because I am woman, I am proud to be me.  

If you don’t watch out for me stalking you stalking me!  I AM Woman! Yes.

"This is great I say this because I could not not want to be more than then your truth in self, also because I want it also to have a back n' forth to it, ya know ebb n flow! But of course being man I feel in a different frequency than women it's true, (I say this because all guys say say I'm a emotional female type. Nope I just get how our differences work.) however that being said there is a reason so many misread me. I truly believe it's because they seek knowledge of who I am from others am I this unapproachable or scary. So right off I feel a little bit what?... Not quite normal but when I am forced to feel pain in so powerful a volume because I am left out the loop in tears my heart and leaves broken. Everyone ask for open page like truth I give but somehow because I do not demand it I'm not taken seriously until I say okay I must go this is to unhealthy. Then I'm a giant monster who just plays games and hates women. Well it likely should be in most people eyes but nothing is further from the truth. Now I am lost to all it feels like I can not make that first move. Getting hurt or even worst hurting another it has me really terrified me and this is what happens to me now when I feel to slightest connection. I get drawn in so fast and its perfect if they remain unavailable I am perfect suto relationship and only I'm aware but if they start giving me openings I'd bit right?!

But of course being man I feel in a different frequency than women it&amp;#39;s true, (I say this because all guys say say I&amp;#39;m a emotional female type. Nope I just get how our differences work.) however that being said there is a reason so many misread me. I truly believe it&amp;#39;s because they seek knowledge of who I am from others am I this unapproachable or scary. So right off I feel a little bit what?... Not quite normal but when I am forced to feel pain in so powerful a volume because I am left out the loop in tears my heart and leaves broken. Everyone ask for open page like truth I give but somehow because I do not demand it I&amp;#39;m not taken seriously until I say okay I must go this is to unhealthy. Then I&amp;#39;m a giant monster who just plays games and hates women. Well it likely should be in most people eyes but nothing is further from the truth. Now I am lost to all it feels like I can not make that first move. Getting hurt or even worst hurting another it has me really terrified me and this is what happens to me now when I feel to slightest connection. I get drawn in so fast and its perfect if they remain unavailable I am perfect suto relationship and only I&amp;#39;m aware but if they start giving me openings I&amp;#39;d bit right?!

Now before you ask, how you fit within it all, ask yourself how it was all created? If I am to answer, then you must know that you dance between the constellations I’ve created, as I lay in my bed. 

You bend the cosmos together and from the dust create explosions of dopamine within me that flash across the night’s sky. A blinding shower of meteors, painting the darkness in a bewitching storm of flames.

"I lay awake in bed, the storms rage.
Alone in my head, wishing instead.
The storm rages on, goes round.
Like the loud ceiling fan.

Without your touch, I feel dead.
Everything is plain spoken, I am broken.
They can't understand!

Just who I am, in this world where everything has been made, to be broken!
My face against yours, I feel your warmth.

My head laying on your breast, just you know who I am!
Your arms my heaven, your breast my home.
I taste the saline in your tears, when I draw near.
Trying too just to understand, know who I am!

The tears I bleed, to just know who I am!
I Just want you to know who I am! In this fragmented torn up world!

"How many letters more

before your love reciprocates?

How many letters more

until your true love manifests?

How many letters more

before you're in each others arms?

&amp;#x200B;

Who really knows???

&amp;#x200B;

But how many letters more

before you go completely crazy?

and how many more accounts to make

before your personality is lost completely?

&amp;#x200B;

While you are writing letters, day after day, month after month.......years.....

They are living

maybe not ""loving""

but they are out there, facing reality, becoming different people and dealing with life's twists and turns.

What have they done? To be condemned... To be lied to, talked about, fantasized and slandered.... made into a figment of your reality, which does not exist... 

I beg of you

They might not yet know, but I do, and you owe it to me to let me see the real you. Back then I wouldn't care at all in the least what you looked like, where you worked, if you worked, what education level or criminal history... I just wanted you. The woman I fell so deeply in love with. The woman who's flaws matched mine and energy just dissolved into my own personal storage. The supply that I never asked for but desperately got addicted to. I can only hope I managed to supply you with equal product, though some might call that co dependent. But how can you depend on someone who lied to you, lied ON you, and stood and watched..

The only thing wrong was that you underestimated my will to love you. You overlooked my quietness and agreeability and I caught you red-handed. In the act of evil, In the name of love?

I rest my case

"Tis a dream. By all accounts it must be. To lay beside you and feel such peace. Must I wake from this lucid bliss? What manner of kiss will break this spell I wonder… 

A fool I must be for wanting. To shred this thin veil that rests gently between us. Its silken touch stroking the tension in transience. Your very presence puts me in a trance. That part of me hasn’t left your side yet. 

My mind lingers upon your warmth. A soft pulse to answer eager lips. Let me dream a little longer… Just to breathe you in… a scent so intoxicating to the senses… you seduce my judgement. 

How I want to rip this veil that separates us and ravish you. Make each breath escape from pleasured lips.

You’ve given me many a moment to ponder upon with rampant desire my dearest Ant Queen; like any moment, it is over in an instant. The clock has struck midnight, mademoiselle, and I must bid you adieu. 

Sleep well and Sweetest dreams darling… I ever wait for the next adventure.

My heart algorithmic, bleeding out!

A love so pure, yet so hard to fake.
Like devouring an empty cupcake.
I want to touch you, to feel you your skin.
To touch and feel is it a sin?
My emotions, they’re running so deep,
My love for her, I can’t even sleep!
I am losing my mind,
Wishing for my someone, my one of a kind.
So let’s sing these lyrics, hearts open and bare,
And hope that someday, my someone will be there.

I am in love with you.

And it hurts. I was getting better. I really was. Then it started getting worse. It's not as bad as December, but, god, it hurts. The pain is my proof, but, fuck, how do you neurotypicals put up with this? Do you suffer this much over everything?

I should be working right now, but I can't. I want to stand in front of you and tell you everything. I want to pour it out to you. I want you to understand. I want you to believe me. But I'm not allowed to say it to a married woman.

What would you do if you knew? Hate me? Fear me? Pity me? Love me back? Give up your life for me? No. I'm not stupid. You would be pragmatic. You would understand. You would accept. And you would walk away. I would be a hiccup in your day. Nothing more. Never anything more. You would be busy with your own life. I would be an anomaly to you. I might earn a shrug and some false sympathy before you returned to something that mattered to you.

But, I am in love with you.

What am I supposed to do? Forget the only person I will ever love? Abandon an emotion I wanted my whole life? I DID NOTHING WRONG! I also did nothing right. I succeeded at the impossible and failed at life. I found everything I wanted but never gave myself the chance to earn it. What am I left with?

I am in love with you.

"Fast And Testominy Day

My Testimony

On my knees in prayer to feel that small still 
"" burning of my bosom"" for truth rather than a lie. I've prayed that our book of love would be true, that I love you and only you! Your words are gospel truth to me, and that is far as much you love me. And that you are a prophet two us! And your love is true. That this is the ""true  church"" on the face of the earth; and other planetary interludes similar to ""Kolob!"" 

And sooner than later, we can make sweet love to each other. Sealing our fate to the outer darkness! Of this, I bear witness that our love is true! Now I lay here thinking of you, I and I'm on fire I can't sleep! So to the Devil with the formalities on my way over! In the Saveyur's Name,
Amen

No loud after..laughter...❤️❤️☕
P.S. Don't tell the Bishop 
And this is similar to my TBM experience.

"Words have been my biggest form of expression.
I speak from my heart, from my soul, from everything inside of me that makes me who I am.
Words have been my constant companion.

When I think of you....my mind spins. My heart flutters and dances inside, the whole of me just sings. 
Sings without words that I can repeat or write. There are no words that can completely encapsulate just how I feel for you. How so completely I've fallen for you. Everything cries out to you. Cries out for you.

We've never touched yet, I ache for the press of your fingers against my skin. We've never kissed, yet I can feel your lips on my neck, moving along my body when you tell me of how you wish to do just so. I feel your luagh embrace my heart with every tone, its a song I never get tired of hearing, especially when I make it come out.  Every moment feels like the first, feels like a wish I never hoped to come true. 

Every part of you, of what we share is so....I wish I had the words for it all.

No...I wish I could wrap you inside of my heart, let you feel all of it...all of me and the depth in which I feel for you. Every word that escapes me, that I cannot grasp. Every word that is for you lives there. If you could feel the song of my heart around you, feel how completely I love you....

But I can't wrap you inside of it, I can't make you feel what is so strong in me...yet I want to try.
I want to try and make you hear it, feel it, see it. I want to try and show you when I can say it, and scream it to the world when I have the words. 
My love may be overwhelming for you, it could be to much.

I hope you can forgive me in those moments.
I hope you want  brave the wave that is me.
I hope one day you feel it, that your heart hears the love in mine. That your heart and soul feel it wrap around you, I hope you feel the wave that is me and let it wash over you completely.

I hope you'll want to drown in the love that is me.


These words don't feel altogether right, I'm sorry if they are strange. As I mentioned before the better words escape me. You leave me dumbstruck, intoxicated to losing all compression of the words I may use in place of these.
Hopefully you see their truth, feel them in your heart.

"I put you all in the same group not to generalize, not to stereotype, not to be lazy, and not to hurt or feel pitted against eachother... but because I'm focusing on one little girl, my daughter, and right now I am putting her first and reserving everyone else place for after her and I are happy and no longer in a state of suffering..

I love you guys

You are so unique in your own ways and I wouldn't be the man I would be today without any of you. I'm sure some of you would be hurt to know you are in the group of women im writing to and don't get your own section, but imagine how my wife feels... and if shes on the waiting list, no one else is before her either.

I am hurting so badly. But I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you guys. Over the last few years in different times and situations, you have all saved me. 

Some of you I hurt without provocation, some of you I ghosted, some of you ghosted me, and some of you kicked me while I was already down.. The point of it is.. I'm sorry. I'm truly very sorry for the pain I HAVE CAUSED.. The pain that you have caused me does not matter. I am moving forward, even though sometimes I take two right steps accidentally, I wont stop moving, with or without any of you.

I am talking to you people that know me through letters and from youtube, If you don't fall into that category this is not for you. Just know that I will never hurt any of you again. I will not ignore a message, and I will not be deceitful in anyway. But with that said I also will not approach, as I know not what you would do or how you would feel. I don't want to open wounds or make situations worse.

I hereby announce that I will never do anything negative to any of you again. I learned a great lesson this past year, and I hope you all have too, and are happy, well, and find the love you desperately seek here..

Sending dank chill vibes to all,

"I watched eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and what I see is: two people who are doing everything they can to stay together. Separation is impossible, they are in one another’s blood, they are a viruses for one another, contagious, they infect each other. 

This movie is a great representation of childhood trauma manifesting itself in adulthood, how they hold back, and the crazy ways they heal themselves. 

I love how they wake up on the beach after his mother catches him….. 

They were an amazing mess together. They were a beautiful disaster. They were truly in love. 

What more can one ask for than a love that is real and unbridled. 

How beautiful. 

How foolish they were to throw it away in the first place. 

And then they start again.

"A,

I’ve been debating whether to tell you this or not, since it sounds a little crazy.  I just wanted to tell you that you’re very special to me and I’ve realized I still have some feelings for you.  I thought I moved on years ago, but to be honest I never forgot about you.  Over the years, little things would remind me of you. In hindsight I’ve noticed when they did, I would purposefully push those thoughts of you out of my mind.  I guess I was afraid to think about you too much?  That I would start to miss you again?  Honestly, I wanted to reconnect with you sooner.  I guess I was afraid of being rejected and that hearing from me would be unwelcome.  

You were and always will be my first love.  You gave me some of the happiest days of my life.  No small feat considering I had lost my dad earlier that year and was still grieving him.  I remember we would listen to Faith Hill and I would get lost in your beautiful blue eyes.  Eyes that were looking back at with me with so much love, along with your heart melting smile.  It felt like time stood still for us. You gave me many moments and days like that.  Ones that I wish could’ve lasted forever.  I could go on and on about the things I remember about our time together.  It’s bittersweet that I have such vivid memories of you.

It’s hard not to think of what could’ve been.  It seems like we had a lot of unexplored potential.  Although I guess we weren’t meant to be together, we’re both married to other people after all.  I just wish we could’ve been together longer. I wish I would’ve said I love you the moment you said it to me.  I was a confused kid at the time.  When I finally said it, I guess it was too late.  I also wish I hadn’t gotten so clingy once we went to school.  I’m sorry I leaned on you too much.  It’s just that you made me feel safe during a time of so much change in my life.  I often wonder if changing those things would’ve made a difference.  I don’t really know.  Maybe just being 19 and at 2 different colleges, 2 hours away was really all it took.  All I know is that I never wanted to lose you.  Losing you was one of the hardest heartbreaks in my life next to losing my dad.  I’m not telling you that to make you feel guilty.  I just want you to know how hard I fell for you.  

I feel foolish for still having feelings for you.  We’re both married and it was so long ago. In the scheme of things we dated for a short amount of time.  On the other hand, just a day can change your life forever.  So for me, our time together was significant.  I can only hope it was significant to you as well. Anyway, I hope you don’t think I’m ridiculous or crazy for feeling the way I do.  I fear that I don’t mean nearly as much to you.  I hope there’s a small place in your heart for me and that our time together meant something to you too.  

It’s been great hearing updates about your life.  I hope we can continue to touch base once in awhile.  If not, I understand.  Like I said before, I wouldn’t want to cause any conflict in your life.  I’d just like to contribute to your happiness in some small way if I could as your friend.

Anyway, please forgive my intrusion into your life.  This isn’t meant as an attempt to win you back or anything like that. I just couldn’t keep these feelings to myself any longer. I’ve buried them deep down long enough.  I just wanted you to know what you mean to me.  I’m thankful for the privilege of being part of your life.  Thank you for being part of mine.

Yours forever,

"My dearest Ant Queen,

If we had met in any place other than class, I’d have never had the confidence to gaze in your direction. You just so happened to catch me in a moment I thrive in.

Entranced by the nectar that rolled from your lips… the allure of your thoughts, drawing me into the wonders that sat behind ardent eyes. You sat there… comfortably, in the tiny fold-up chair. Your knees nuzzled up to your chest… I knew I had succumb to your grace. 

I’ve never felt this tightening of my chest as it is overwhelmed with warmth, gazing at someone before. I don’t know how else to explain the rush that is sent through me in your presence. I’ve often considered it to be a brush of lust, yet, never have I ever felt the need to protect that precious part of you that is let out when you are at peace. 

To admit I’ve become addicted to the warmth you provide is an understatement. It borders that of the celestial. The rise of the sun, the tug from an endless sea of waves greeting the moon. 

I need you… I only wish I had the elegance to say it… 

Irrevocably yours, “Billy”",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-03-19T06:25:17.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dearest Ant Queen,&lt;/p&gt;

"I have refrained from talking to you per our agreement, but I cannot hold the urge to talk to you anymore and have decided to write you a letter. This should be an easy letter to write – words should come effortlessly in describing my feelings of solitude, or how happy I was not long ago. But somehow, I can’t possible say all in a letter like I should like to. I have been reduced to a boy with his heart and mind in two different places, one that is depressed, incessantly living over memories of your caresses, your tears, your affectionate solicitude, and your company. Everything my saddened eyes see, sparks in my mind another memory of us. Worst is during the sleepless hours of the night, when I have no distractions from my thoughts of you, as the image of your smile is painted on the walls of my conscience. Many of these long nights, I dream of you, waking up with rage, jealousy, sadness, or resentfulness for the way I handled everything. In the most recent one, I felt hopeless and defeated as you sat with a man of high stature, him giving you what you have always needed, love respect and confidence. After drowning my sorrows in liquor and weed for weeks, I aim to become that man, for both you and me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly, I don’t think you realise how fascinatingly beautiful you have always been to me D.B., and how strangely you have acquired an added and special loveliness. My love has made me selfish of those around you and it is almost like I cannot exist without you. I just miss you, in a quite simple desperate human way. I miss you even more than I could have believed; and I was prepared to miss you a good deal. So this letter is really just a squeal of pain, as I recognize now how essential to me you have become. 

&amp;#x200B;

John Green once wrote “You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world...but you do have some say in who hurts you”. You chose me, and I hurt you. I broke your trust in me, and I know it hurts you more than it has hurt me. I am deeply sorry for this pain I caused you, and even more sorry for doing it at such an inconvenient time. I remember how things were the last time we spoke, and it hurts whenever the thought of losing you forever crosses my mind. In the end, I just want to be your hero, the only person you trust to put their life on the line for you. I am afraid my actions have made this title unobtainable, so instead, I want you to remember that you are worth more than anything I could ever lose and that there is a permanent place for you in my heart. From now till ever, I will always hold you in high esteem because you deserve nothing but endless affection. 

&amp;#x200B;

Take care, good luck in your exams and have fun in America. I hope you can find someone worth your time soon.

"S, 
hope ‘23 is good &amp; you’re not overdoing yoga yet 🧘‍♀️ 
on holiday there, got asked my religion…reminded me of our brief English pals… 🤔💭

December seemed to be lining up things, ambiguity played on my mind, so I enjoyed the gig, didn’t check messages till Sunday. 

Always liked the S I knew back in 15/16. You were engaged then, but you were the friendly, sweet girl who helped me settle in, sharing links, favourite TWD moments &amp; faint whispers of Java knowledge. Some choice looks &amp; msgs near the end of that era… just remember thinking there was more there…

So was excited when I realised it was no tinder bot last summer reaching out. You were the sexiest &amp; smartest girl on our msc…in 22 that extended to every woman I’ve ever met. Was looking forward to finding out what makes her tick 👌

Reconnecting really shook things loose I’ve had to let go. Regret getting so frustrated with each other...didn’t know each other properly yet, years since we tried making sense of coding together over boojums, but those times took on new meaning for me.

Shame we lost touch, I’d understand today’s S better. Probably both guilty of pride &amp; prejudice about each other since we reconnected.

Learned hell of a lot about myself. No time machine or genie lamp in this crazy world, but I believe, broken things can be made new when people grow &amp; forgive.

Misunderstood the cryptic lines…Never been blocked 
before, regret texting, logic gone when frustrated 🤷‍♂️ 

figured any break offs would be amicable after our call…just didn’t know when/what the unblock/block craic was 😕

Was excited to make up lost time and have fun 🤘now, understand any mixed signals were you being cautious 👍 Didn’t mean to overwhelm or overthink…genuinely not wrestled such strong feelings before.

Hard getting that gaze of yours out of my head, something between headlights in the rain &amp; jungle cats in the bush. Taste of that September kiss haunts me.

Universe never lined up so well before…second guessed being sent a good thing, my ego was so afraid of getting hurt, didn’t plan for how I’d miss out on something with you.

Maybe one day soon you’ll remember our craic, not frustration. Perhaps if we’d both shared a little more, this ghost story would have a different ending. 

Really hope you’re happy, get out of scummy b____and living your best life, on the 🏖️🧘‍♀️🏝️ #offmychest

Damn I wish I was your lover,

I wish I was the breeze
That softly caresses your skin
On a warm summer’s evening.
I wish I was the sun
That warms your face with its rays
And brings a smile to your lips.
I wish I was the rain 
That gently falls upon you 
As you dance in its embrace.
Oh, how I long to be 
The one who fills your heart with love 
And brings you endless joy.
Oh, I can only dream
I wish I was the one that one…
Who makes your heart skip a beat 
And fills your dreams with never ending bliss.
For you are the one that one I love 
With every beat of my heart 
And every breath I take.
You will be watching me
I will watch you stalk you
I will pledge to protect you 
I will pledge to honor you.
I will be in haste just to love you
Am I only dreaming you
I’m missing my dream.
Of purely you only you
Can dreams come true
I resonate, sing with Sophie.
Damn, I wish I was your lover!!
Even those mismatched shoes
Yes! Yes! Yes, they are the only shoes that fit!!
Can't imagine growing out of them
There is no other like just you
That’s why in my cheesy way proclaim I love you!

"
Of all the stars that shine up above,
You are the one that I cherish and love.
Through thick and thin, you've been my rock,
Your caring heart, always there to unlock.

Your beauty shines brighter than the sun,
In your embrace, I feel like the only one.
Every moment spent with you, a treasure trove,
My love for you, forever, shall behove.

In this world of chaos and strife,
You are my beacon of light,
With you by my side, I know we'll thrive,
Together, we'll conquer every fight.

My love for you flows like a river,
Always fresh, always pure,
And in my heart, you shall forever be the giver,
Of happiness, love, and so much more.

So, my dear, take this poem as a token,
Of my love and admiration, never to be broken,

"I know, that's a ridiculous cliché title, but you did (and here's the rest of this ridiculous cliché sentence) save me from myself.

After all the shit I've been through in my failed love life, I took an easier and safer path, keeping myself away from any potentially hurtful situation. 

Which means away from love. 

Since this letter started with that cliché, I'll give you another one: love hurts. It really fucking hurts but it's also the best thing it can happen to anyone. 

I chose to not deal with this anymore until you came into my life. Let's just skip the how and when and focus on the facts.

You came and reminded me how amazing it feels to have my heart beating so fast whenever I think of you. Reminded me of that tickling sensation when all the butterflies get all flustered in my stomach.

Suddenly I was alive again, and only then I realized I'd been dead for a long time. 

You probably don't know the things you did for me only by walking into my life. Even the bad parts, I take it all, it's all part of loving another flawed human being. 

This, THIS right here, is a thank you letter. Thank you for showing me I'm not dead, thank you for trying to love my imperfect self, I know you did the best you could. 

I did too, but I'm just not good at it, as you can tell. 

So thank you. Thank you for everything, for all that, so much.

No, I don't expect you to come back now, I just had to thank you.

 You,

I stare into my blank screen reading you. in love without you 404.
I want to know intimacy, your affection, you know who... my unseen possession.
I ponder who you are, where you are never too far... lover?
I consider contemplate evaluate, those eyes your grace your style.
I am unbalanced, unhinged, tormented, demented, and my brain insane.
I toss and turn and burn smitten bitten your bitter words the day before.
I stare at your selfie you are sitting there giving strangers a blank lonely stare.
I know others want a one-night stand they sit and glare.
I want to be there forever, playing with your hair in the morning without care.
I would roll the dice thrice to win you and that's just not being nice my love.
I want to turn those frowny lips into a smirky grin smile, no spin if I was a marine, I cry ""Semper Fi. ""Always faithful.""
I TORMENTED HAUNTED!
I am thinking of you on two occasions day and night. you are my phoenix take flight!
I want don't want to gawk or stalk.
I want to make love to you reminding the sheets of who they are...you and me.
I would eat my breakfast cereal with your ""pepper"" on top.
I am obsessed with your love with every jot tit and syllable.
I will, will yes only you protect you from the hounds of hell why?
I would gladly go to bloody hell and back for you my best friend.
I look at the time it's been 16 hours of babble on my screen since you took your love away.

I miss your sweetness in my hands, I have tasted strange fruit. The serpent beguiling me I did eat! I hid myself between your breasts your heartbeat, and your breathing made me a sinner, but I didn't care. Remembering your intense stare I felt invincible grabbing the stars and presenting them as a bouquet to you. The sheets testimonies of our expressed love i don't have much to offer than some truth mingled with lovers' lies.

"HEY SIRI: play The Association~ Never My Love 💞
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I have this huge hole in my heart, but there is no bitterness, it just feels like my assault/robbery that day at the gas station over and over and over. Emptiness, hopeless, terrifying, hoping to get through this, and oh so fucking painful……. I remember laying there on the ground thinking this was the end for me and there wasn’t some amazing flashback, no light to come over me, just my body enduring what it had to go through. I’m still amazed that whatever deity actually allowed me to survive. I honestly just want the pain to end, leave me just as easily as you left me…
I don’t see you as a mistake—I’ll always love you. I don’t know if it’s possible for me to stop. It’s been a year and three months since I moved out, because I was hurting so much from how little I mattered to you. I was once your all but then you became a “me”. I still remember all of the amazing memories and experiences we had together, the way you looked at me that just told me he’s my person—my soulmate the one I wanted to keep growing with forever. I always said it was kismet from the moment we met. Yes, our journey was riddled with obstacles with my brain injury and PTSD— but life is never easy. You were there for me at the worst time in my life that I ever endured and for that I will always be grateful to you. You don’t know how many days and nights I was just trying to be strong and “be normal”. When I was literally terrified and scared a lot of the time. You made me feel safe, you helped me brave the world again with your light. Honestly I know I would not have survived this without your kindness, patience, love, and so so much support. I was very angry with you towards the end though, to be honest. I was so fucking mad at you. I was blaming you for not being able to “show up” for me. I realized that I missed so many signs and moments that would have told me you were over me. You just kept reassuring me how much you loved me and you would always be there for me. I went back and thought about everything again and again and again. You know I guess it’s just like you feel, truly not meant to be. It was real for me though and this ending completely crushed my spirit that you helped me get back to, that part me that was left to survive anyway. I was just yearning and clinging and trying to hold on so hard just to keep our dead love alive. It was good that you buried it and you decided to become a ghost. I know I have said many things to you about the ways I felt, I don’t even know if you ever really heard me. You hurt me so deep my heart literally shattered with those horrible last words— “I think that you love me more than I love you” and all I constantly wonder is how long did I mean that little to you? Why did you continue to treat me like I didn’t matter knowing that you were saying the words “I love you” but truly incapable of projecting the actual meaning of love? I felt it and the sad part is I said that to you— I really tried to give you your space. I also asked you if we should end this amicably with love still so we could part as friends. You were too stubborn to let me go then I guess and just kept on reassuring me of your love and everything was fine. I should have trusted my instincts, you taught me to never dismiss them, so thanks for that! You know, we ended up saying the worst things when we were hurting. And we both were hurting in different ways emotionally. You being SO non-confrontational and unable to communicate wanting out— I wasn’t what you wanted anymore. Then me just desperately wanting to keep your love so much I lost myself in the process. Not that I wasn’t lost with my brain injury and learning to be a new person when I barely even remembered myself. I also realized my PTSD was not easy to deal with those first traumatic months- imagine how I felt?? So let’s not apologize, reason, or seek approval. We were tired of those same endless fights, weren’t we? I think so…. right? I think closure is all I truly wanted from you because I just couldn’t understand and still don’t— I desperately needed the blatant truth once and for all. I don’t want it from you anymore though. I am just here pouring my heart out. This is my closure whether you know it or not is not my problem because it’s only for me. You don’t exist anymore— but that’s what you chose to do to me because I was not worth it to you or for you. I will always be ashamed that I could not tell because I was too blinded by false love in the ending to see it was already gone. I trusted you, I trusted your words to me, yet they were all lies in the end. For what?!?! Unfortunately it took me this long to realize that. Do you even know when things got bad? Because I do…. it was when your words were no longer matching your actions. You started to make me feel disrespected and you stopped communicating with me. I went to bed, feeling unappreciated and worthless as I laid there alone. Or sitting in the living room alone waiting for you to come home from work with a homemade dinner waiting. I thought this was not a big enough a reason to leave— I didn’t know the ways you would keep letting me down slowly breaking my heart to pieces. You always made your choice, I hope you remember that. Then when I finally left we still agreed to try to work it out and you were going to do the work to and get therapy. Always giving me words of affirmation, a future with us written in the stars— destiny; kismet. Until that last night I would ever see or speak to you in the end of September when you told me you met HER one night in Chicago…. after we sat laughing and reminiscing eating sushi for dinner. Those kisses still lingering in my memory and on my lips. All the tears and laughter that night fixing my guitar, me trying to be respectful of you moving on but still desperately wishing I was enough. You laying in my lap crying while I ran my fingers through your hair telling you I’d be okay…. knowing in my heart that’s not what I wanted at all. I wanted us back, I wanted the days and nights back when you couldn’t wait to be by my side. I wanted the man that always cared about my feelings and wanted to be there for me. Respect and communication are what keeps a relationship alive after the initial spark. It keeps suffocating you, that burn in your heart when you fight to be treated with respect. You did not respect me, you did not value me. For you, it was no issue. And for me, it was everything. That's where we started to grow apart. I will never have regrets about this decision anymore. It was critical for me to keep what was left of my dignity intact. I wish you all the happiness and love in the world. However, I hope that we don’t cross paths again, ever. I no longer want to keep in touch, it would always be one-sided anyway. I want us to just live peacefully and very much apart from each other. I have almost healed already and really started enjoying living again.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-03-13T06:54:24.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEY SIRI: play The Association~ Never My Love 💞

It’s been a year and three months since I moved out, because I was hurting so much from how little I mattered to you. I was once your all but then you became a “me”. I still remember all of the amazing memories and experiences we had together, the way you looked at me that just told me he’s my person—my soulmate the one I wanted to keep growing with forever. I always said it was kismet from the moment we met. Yes, our journey was riddled with obstacles with my brain injury and PTSD— but life is never easy. You were there for me at the worst time in my life that I ever endured and for that I will always be grateful to you. You don’t know how many days and nights I was just trying to be strong and “be normal”. When I was literally terrified and scared a lot of the time. You made me feel safe, you helped me brave the world again with your light. Honestly I know I would not have survived this without your kindness, patience, love, and so so much support. I was very angry with you towards the end though, to be honest. I was so fucking mad at you. I was blaming you for not being able to “show up” for me. I realized that I missed so many signs and moments that would have told me you were over me. You just kept reassuring me how much you loved me and you would always be there for me. I went back and thought about everything again and again and again. You know I guess it’s just like you feel, truly not meant to be. It was real for me though and this ending completely crushed my spirit that you helped me get back to, that part me that was left to survive anyway. I was just yearning and clinging and trying to hold on so hard just to keep our dead love alive. It was good that you buried it and you decided to become a ghost. I know I have said many things to you about the ways I felt, I don’t even know if you ever really heard me. You hurt me so deep my heart literally shattered with those horrible last words— “I think that you love me more than I love you” and all I constantly wonder is how long did I mean that little to you? Why did you continue to treat me like I didn’t matter knowing that you were saying the words “I love you” but truly incapable of projecting the actual meaning of love? I felt it and the sad part is I said that to you— I really tried to give you your space. I also asked you if we should end this amicably with love still so we could part as friends. You were too stubborn to let me go then I guess and just kept on reassuring me of your love and everything was fine. I should have trusted my instincts, you taught me to never dismiss them, so thanks for that! You know, we ended up saying the worst things when we were hurting. And we both were hurting in different ways emotionally. You being SO non-confrontational and unable to communicate wanting out— I wasn’t what you wanted anymore. Then me just desperately wanting to keep your love so much I lost myself in the process. Not that I wasn’t lost with my brain injury and learning to be a new person when I barely even remembered myself. I also realized my PTSD was not easy to deal with those first traumatic months- imagine how I felt?? So let’s not apologize, reason, or seek approval. We were tired of those same endless fights, weren’t we? I think so…. right? I think closure is all I truly wanted from you because I just couldn’t understand and still don’t— I desperately needed the blatant truth once and for all. I don’t want it from you anymore though. I am just here pouring my heart out. This is my closure whether you know it or not is not my problem because it’s only for me. You don’t exist anymore— but that’s what you chose to do to me because I was not worth it to you or for you. I will always be ashamed that I could not tell because I was too blinded by false love in the ending to see it was already gone. I trusted you, I trusted your words to me, yet they were all lies in the end. For what?!?! Unfortunately it took me this long to realize that. Do you even know when things got bad? Because I do…. it was when your words were no longer matching your actions. You started to make me feel disrespected and you stopped communicating with me. I went to bed, feeling unappreciated and worthless as I laid there alone. Or sitting in the living room alone waiting for you to come home from work with a homemade dinner waiting. I thought this was not a big enough a reason to leave— I didn’t know the ways you would keep letting me down slowly breaking my heart to pieces. You always made your choice, I hope you remember that. Then when I finally left we still agreed to try to work it out and you were going to do the work to and get therapy. Always giving me words of affirmation, a future with us written in the stars— destiny; kismet. Until that last night I would ever see or speak to you in the end of September when you told me you met HER one night in Chicago…. after we sat laughing and reminiscing eating sushi for dinner. Those kisses still lingering in my memory and on my lips. All the tears and laughter that night fixing my guitar, me trying to be respectful of you moving on but still desperately wishing I was enough. You laying in my lap crying while I ran my fingers through your hair telling you I’d be okay…. knowing in my heart that’s not what I wanted at all. I wanted us back, I wanted the days and nights back when you couldn’t wait to be by my side. I wanted the man that always cared about my feelings and wanted to be there for me. Respect and communication are what keeps a relationship alive after the initial spark. It keeps suffocating you, that burn in your heart when you fight to be treated with respect. You did not respect me, you did not value me. For you, it was no issue. And for me, it was everything. That&amp;#39;s where we started to grow apart. I will never have regrets about this decision anymore. It was critical for me to keep what was left of my dignity intact. I wish you all the happiness and love in the world. However, I hope that we don’t cross paths again, ever. I no longer want to keep in touch, it would always be one-sided anyway. I want us to just live peacefully and very much apart from each other. I have almost healed already and really started enjoying living again.&lt;/p&gt;

"Is this what life should be like? How is it possible not to lose one's mind in all this insanity. I get mad, because it's too much. When you ask me to do one more thing and come on, how can that be this important, now. When the kids are annoying. When this whole society is too dumb too even get the most simple things done. Another stupidity here and another stupidity there and can I just lean back and have some quiet. When even our own people screw up so ridiculously. Another diet, another attempt to quit smoking, another day I drank too much. So I lose my temper. And I am mean to you and to the kids. And I cry.  I cry, and I feel I can't do it any more. And when it carries on, I feel emptier and emptier. I try to kill my mind with absurd, because: What's left? That's exactly what this life is, this is my scream because I can't take it any more. And if this is all shit, well, then let's shit this shitty shit to shit and paint it pink. I am tired. And it's not right and that, most of all, is killing me. But even that implies some good, but we all deserve it, don't we? There is no good. And it's too much in all that pointless suffering and stupidity. And you don't understand. You do, but, you don't. I'm lonely when you don't, and I need you so. And if I'm honest: I've lost it. I don't care any more. On some level deep down, I just know that nothing matters, and it doesn't go away any more. So why not, why anything? We are all lying, we are all monsters. So what.

And so another day goes on. And I go through the motions and I know we are lucky, maybe we are the one sweet spot in history. But I just want to scream. I should be happy, but too often I feel like I can't take it any more or just so tired, so empty.

And then, when the darkness lifts, I start feeling it again. How I love the kids. How lucky we are. To have what we have. Enjoy life.  And you, my partner in crime, everyday, to be lucky to share life with you and go through other people's madness together. And love is still the answer.

And someday, maybe, I will heal, and the pain will go away, the smiles will be real and last. And the feeling of love and calm will stay and permeate my pain, heal what's cracking again and again for good. When I realize that I am more than enough. When I found that this is enough, that I've done what I'm supposed to do. When I stop being scared of the others.

It will heal the pain that makes me explode like a toddler. It will make me softer and more responsible, so much more stable. But for now, even I would never admit it, without you, I would be lost. This might not be enough. There's so much other's achieve, is this really all there is for me? But I don't really mean that, I know those things don't matter. It's the small narcissistic moment I have sometimes, but who doesn't? You me, our life, at the end of our days I know I will lean back, my dog and me coming back from our long solitary walks, home to you, talk about the kids, lean back and know we had a good life, you and me. But now, I'm not that strong, that I'm not alone, that you hold my hand, I need that more than I admit. I will be. I will understand all this and I will find what I'm missing, my task or realize that I'd found it all along. But I'm smart enough to know that you, our kids, are a big part of that.

Thank you.

"Dear Intermeddlers

You  appear to have taken it upon yourselves to insert yourself into our  relationship, and draw conclusions about matters that neither concern  you, nor require your input or interference.

Not  only is this a massive breach of trust as your shenanigans have not  been disclosed to the person you believe you are trying to ""protect"",  but your actions are harmful and are causing us both undue stress and  anxiety.

Irrespective of what is  going on between the two of us, and who has done what, it is not your  place to make assumptions, draw conclusions or decide on any course of  action on how to ""tackle"" the ""problem"" as you 1) are not a party to  said relationship; 2) know nothing about the issues being worked on by  the parties to said relationship; 3) have no idea what the person whom  you are trying to ""protect"" knows about what is going on; 4) you are  actually causing harm to that person; 5) it is none of your f\*\*\*\*\*\*  business; and 6) you are all adults, so maybe try acting like it.

I  mentioned to him that I thought his workmate Bris had been lurking  around in past weeks along with others who have been subjecting me to  online abuse, based on the username which has since been deleted.

I  understand your concern, and I appreciate you all care for him a lot.   But perhaps you failed to consider that we have a strong relationship,  but are not immune to relationship troubles, and are actively working on  resolving issues, and are committed to making the relationship work.   Your unwanted and unwarranted covert interference and underhanded  tactics is causing major issues which is actually doing more harm than  good.  It may have also failed to cross any of your minds that he would  be absolutely mortified if he knew that you were the ones behind what  has been going on, and have been collectively sabotaging his  relationship.

Making assumptions  is a very dangerous thing to do.  It is also extremely disrespectful to  insert yourself into the relationship matters of workmates/employees as  clearly these activities have been occurring during business hours too.

If  you felt any cause for concern, the appropriate thing would have been  to raise it with one of us, before embarking on a campaign to destroy  two peoples' lives.

You do not  know the dynamics of our relationship, you are not in our relationship -  mind your own business and despite the clear disrespect their appears  to be for me, please respect him and his feelings and right to resolve  his relationship matters himself.  It is neither appropriate nor  justified for any of you to do what you are doing and you need to stop  all of this nonsense immediately.

"Bonnie N Clyde Twine Ring

Clyde's memoirs,

Francis and Annie  were blasting at us two! I heard the bullets whispering in my ear things I did not want to hear! Straightway things were clear.  I Clyde remembered when our fate or state benediction was being proclaimed throughout the land. Guilty, guilty, guilty! ""Of loving my Roughie?"" Clyde mumbled. ""Ah ballywhoo!"" Francis mocked! Remembering our rendezvous, sensual sexy groping of each other her love to me expressed vividly describe in my mind as we were running her beautiful body lying nude in front of me straightway and naked on our rusty ole bed. I cannot believe that I won't be able to touch her and feel her I'm thinking as I caress every inch of her body not leaving one square inch untouched! We were quite the pair!  Remembering her breasts being so perfect I felt like I climbed Mount Arafat, swimming through the oceans of reality to arrive. Her gentle hands stroking me and making me get off too! I remember her tossing her swish dress in the trash for my uncanny overalls, she didn't realize it but her ass and creamy thighs made me cum in my trousers. This is my motivating factor for trying to keep her alive! Well not entirely... Her heart being mine as one in this crazy Cosmic universe! We were crazy sillys if you may, I'll never forget Bonnie making the big burly security guard piss his pants like a school boy! (Haha- Hahahehe) Slipping envelopes under my door with love notes at my hostel, we were together but more than  not together in the flesh but in the mind. 

The wire was on fire with our love! God Bonnie how do I get you into this? All of a sudden... I snap out of it ""come on Clyde let's go you Dork!"" Bonnie cried... then all of a sudden crack the bullet! She went down I quickly grabbed her into my arms, then the inevitable she's gonna die and I knew it!  She is the only the truth and love lost in the rain. Bonnie my ray of sunshine in my arms! My final death entry I felt the bullet pierce my back between my shoulder blades. I couldn't hold on things only my memories! They were fading the last thing I remember was falling into her breasts we becoming one as we always have been in history, what will history say of our love probably nothing; unless some crazy ass reporter from Buffalo Bills territory picks it up! It will remember our Dirty Deeds for sure yes! The real story was under that secret cabin rendezvous our moonlight which was our daylight our fantasies are delight explored or noted in my memoirs of us Bonnie and Clyde the Final Destination! Yes.

""Bonnie your overalls! My God, your savory flesh is bleeding out as Francis laughs mockingly! ""I'll get him Bonnie""... As my lovers eyes squinting her teardrops! I cannot will not hold them in my bucket of our future plans. Her tears gently to the ground striking a four-leaf clover! I reach down her legs rubbing what belong to me lovingly she grabbed mine two and smiled. Her trembling hands plucking a tear stained four-leaf clover put it her mouth and kissed mine. Her last breath i gently inhaled a intimate moment her last breath! Forgotteni n time a love story so divine...my eyes closing on the most wonderful human being I've ever known. Here before us lie Bonnie N Clyde hauntly two dry connected leaves drift amoung the tombstones! Still alive! Blowing in the dust a piece of love a twined wedding ring next to it an empty fishbowl.

"        Before I get to the point I just want to let you know that this is not question; nor do you owe me anything whatsoever. I just know that I need to get this off my chest if I want to move forward, I am also not at all asking for a relationship, as I know that it would probably not be healthy for me right now. I will, and already do, respect any way that you might feel about what I’m going to explain. If you need space from me then please, please, please, just let me know. Heck, you don’t even need too if you don’t feel comfortable doing so. Just avoid me if you’d like, do whatever is most comfortable for you.

      In all honesty, me telling you this comes across as very selfish. I’ll probably regret it.

       You are bubbly and upbeat, yet never fail to show immense emotional strength and stability. When I’m near you, I am the happiest. You make what would usually be a drag for me exciting and new. Even when you hurt me, it’s almost a good pain. It’s pain worth suffering through. I’m not sure if it’s healthy at all, it probably isn’t. 

       The truth is, I care about you quite a lot and am willing to put up with just about anything if it means that I get to spend time with you. 

       I just ask that you try your best to understand this. You bring fun into everything we do together, and I want to thank you. You stick to your morals and are persistent, you never give up on what you believe in. I know that me saying this probably sounds pretty awkward, but you are truly an incredible person. I have never, ever, met anybody that made me happier then you do

      Frequently, I find myself worrying that I might be failing as a friend; to make you laugh, smile, and maybe even open up to me. I have no obligation to be your friend, nor do you have one to be mine, but from my perspective you and your feelings are very important to me. Maybe it’s all in my head. After all, I am taking a vague emotion of yours as an immediate reassurance, when really it means nothing. I shouldn’t care so much about what you think. Maybe I am just overreacting, I don’t know anymore. We’re only friends after all. I have lost so many friends in the past, hurting both them and myself. I’m not sure if you talk to me because you want to, or if it’s just out of pity because I seem lonely. Whatever the case is, I know that you are an incredibly kind person and would never try to hurt me, but subconsciously I am taking your behaviours and flipping it around in a way that makes me feel like I’m failing as a friend. When you are happy and positive towards me, I assume that I am succeeding. When I make a mistake or don’t immediately make you happy, for some reason I take it as a bad thing. I really can’t deal with friendship, even though being alone is the most agonizing thing for me. All of this is really selfish of me. Don’t take it personally, it’s not your fault at all. It’s my problem, I just needed to voice it really badly. I couldn’t stand to lose you, and I keep telling myself that I am; even while I logically know that it doesn’t make any sense at all. I just want to know if our friendship is valuable to you, and if it is as important to you as I hope it is, I wish that I could only show you how much it means to me. I would do anything to get to spend more time around you, but I believe that you think that I want space from you. Verbally communicating emotions is really hard for me, if you haven’t noticed. I watch you grow closer with all of your other friends, it hurts to watch. Makes me realize how behind I am. It brings my problems into light. Aside from all of this, it doesn’t help that I am starting to find that I might want to get to know you as a little bit more then a friend.

       But in those moments when I feel like I am making you happy and seeing you laugh, I get the most incredible feeling. I get the feeling that maybe I’m not failing as bad as I thought before. It’s similar to the feeling of infatuation, but it is more a feeling of belonging rather then desire. I guess that by telling you this, I’m asking you to reassure me.

       I had to push myself hard to tell you this, seeing as our friendship might not be worth as much to you, as it does to me. I’m sure you would be very surprised at just how lonely I would be if you weren’t here. I’ve lost all of my friends so many time, I hope this doesn’t sounds desperate, but I can’t stand the idea of losing you as well.
 
       The most upsetting part is that I know that this feeling most likely won’t be mutual. I feel like I betrayed you as a friend.

       I’m so sorry if I damaged our friendship, yet even if I did, I will still be glad that I told you nonetheless. Telling you this was something that I had to do in order to move on, whether we stay friend or not. I really do want to stay friends though.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-03-11T18:47:39.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Before I get to the point I just want to let you know that this is not question; nor do you owe me anything whatsoever.

"When they begin the beguine
It brings back the sound of music so tender,
It brings back a night of tropical splendor,
It brings back a memory ever green.
I'm with you once more under the stars,
And down by the shore an orchestra's playing
And even the palms seem to be swaying
When they begin the beguine.
To live it again is past all endeavor,
Except when that tune clutches my heart,
And there we are, swearing to love forever,
And promising never, never to part.
What moments divine, what rapture serene,
Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted,
And now when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted,
I know but too well what they mean;
So don't let them begin the beguine
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember;
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember
When they begin the beguine.
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play
Till the stars that were there before return above you,
Till you whisper to me once more,
""Darling, I love you!""
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in,
When they begin the beguine

It's 7:11 am, not 3:00 am 

Don't be afraid I'm not that creep that hurt you! You are my copper penny ""check this out"" you are my lost penny in my pocket date stamped out of sync, yet somehow we go deep n sync my silly!  From this ""Wheat Head"" pure penny head. My deep thoughts roll through my head on and on when my fake layers are stripped off one by one my half-phantom my truth lying to myself. I'm not in love! Deserving realms of inquiry your cyber question knows the of of how old married, committed, gay, bi, etc? But you know about soul connects our cosmic ones! Throw the dirt on me I'm not dead, please don't shovel me a writing freak under the dirt yet! Freaking with you intensely truthfully seriously. I love you my influence your inner divine! Now I'm  searching for others casting my intense gaze into the sun! Now I am a blind lover searching for my overall girl in a hobo box train of come on chatter. I chatter too I am sorry. What's wrong with me? You shone like the sun I wanted to bask in your rays of energy getting burned for sitting in your pure energy too long. Next life from a past life we did like the bright sun, 
have fun picking from our big mulberry tree mulberries? I remember playing footsie barefoot us crazies with berry covered faces past life? You Show like the sun... I shine on and beam now. 🤘 Georgeo C eat your own heart! I Grew Older and a little colder and nothing was very much fun anymore. I feel tight as a tourniquet...dry as a funeral drum. I hate it when some unthoughtful person says at a funeral how good I look? I'm dead for Christs sake!! No understanding the person's real life is gone. Does that bug you too? Deviation here sorry!  One of those days, I would contemplate dream just being with you over coffee and sharing good times in bed! Are you in those hot yoga pants too? I like your overalls barefoot my fetish. Ok oh oh! My hot teacher call on me see my hand raised in a crowded place now you would dress Amish? Naah  necked. Then the moment of truth! My heart fell out in front of me BTW I ""make"" Geogeo C look sad lol. You yeah you come along Vera do I need to ask? I have not read anything at all or named excerpts here to you, I hope you know I needed a double dose of my anti-anxiety Med which I quit taking oops, but I feel better being up early with you! Amongst other things a potpourri of poison was prescribed but no difference the out come is the same loss of the feels! I want to reach I have it that I think about writing about crazy stuff with you and I stopped!  I wish I had a bunch 
of encyclopediaes  to tell you how I feel about you. I need a Library of Congress I think LOL or wherever they call it in the UK. I have layed my head on your heart! Is the first thing I posed to you but not prosed from my heart that's a start over!  I don't have to read your Dear John's or fuck you wasay letters. And pick my textual balls off the floor. Or grow new ones. Your ass I think about it and I just enjoy the moment and roll with the laughs the cries, and the hehes! I guess I'm a creep a weirdo, butt ok but. I've  your got your back at any grocery store your crotch grabbing stalker to show how much would do for you. Nynct Sorry to plagiarize Pink and Macy but it's true. Pulling my eyes from my head I'm no Royal just a royal ""r/the asshole"" there I go again plagiarizing for you. You said you accepted me I hope so give me a Karma smoochie a love award? Love textual love. I want more too.  You are my drug. Here's a light Have a Cigar us too catching up us two. So need another light? Do you have a Bic? A crazy one, so...An oldie when I was in diapers was playing on the radio when I become old or mature or immature  just don't call me the dirty old man! I may be? Ha Because I care about you I wouldn't be writing this at 7:11 a.m. One old taboo song""If I could lift you up"" by Bennie M resonated with it may be old and doggy. Now means so much more! Love laments passion, I'm a sucker for romanticism. A taboo fetish today. The temple Knighted ones couldn't accept it in N Lehi Ut. Turned it off the radio and called Bennie a pervert, so it didn't get radio time until I come to the great state of white snow! Well, now it played in my head last night feeling the words. Forget sleeping now it's 8:04 am my sorry ass is still typing. If this is a potpourri of clusterfucked words is because you kept me up late talking you crazy dork from your dork! Can't help but think of those overalls and your couch joke it turned me on! So you started it I have put that at 12:30 am to word.

"The Sheets


Morning sheets imprinted with memories of you. 


The imprints the sheets, The smell of you the sheets.


The morning casts its light on the sheets. Empty now the sheets


If the sheets could talk the sheets. 

What do they say? The sheets 


Being sweat-stained. The salty-sweet smell of lust or commitment. 

The sheets


Would the imprints say you are a sinner 

a lover maybe or a commitment?  The three?  The sheets 


They sang our song they whispered gently in. my ear telling me what I hear.

You have found love! The sheets 


Our imprints remain on The sheets.


Yes! The morning sheets say I ...?

How can I say I never meant to depreciate your worth? Yet you devoured mIne. You

What can I say?

How can I say like Atlas would carry your self doubt and worries and lift you up into the night? 

What can I say? you were my Atlas too. I would carry this crazy earth just for you! Sharing it good. Us two. 

How can I say. I would cry with you? Type with you make passionate love to you! Us yaking two. 

How can I say? let me drink your tears up? Turn your hurt into laughter. Sharing together memories. 

How can I say. I miss our time together? Us two connected like missfitted puzzle pieces? Me and you a coincidence?

How can I say. your naked breasts lay bare in my head textually  your beautiful naked body on your keyboard making love. Us Two. Are you typing nude? 

How can I say? I should lay my hands on you and make the night owl sing our song too. You and me. 

How can I say. textually we should be on the ruling planetary interlude amongst the online chatter? Us Knighted titans. We belong. 

 I miss your textual laugh; hehe hehe! your patience with you slowly removing my heavy mask saw my ugliness I’m carrying  from you.

How can I say? we talk it good really good! Lovers left on repeat. Just spit on me I’ll lick it up! 

I want all of you. Even your tattered and torn pieces. Will you take mine? You and me. 

Most of all being there for you I would never let anyone hurt you I would make them respect you. Would you do the same for me. Yes no mabey?

What can I say? 

I would delete anything I wrote for you.  Even if my backspace/delete was coffee struck. Would you swear at me and call me your dork.  

Yes somewhere out there missing my mark in a crowded room of online desperatly  looking for you.  Hey, you yea you I love you! 

How can I say? That I can't be without you! 

How can I embrace my two-cup coffee emojIcon  for you! Seven months ago. Yup. 

I want to stare Intensely into your eyes.

Textually impossible, need a selfie. Please? 

I dream to lay my hands on you and explore the unknowns with you. Taboo, I’m sweating too. 

How can I say. 

What can I say?

How can I say. I don't know if I can leave that special one? Yup. 

My crow upon my shoulder.

Us or them mentality probably 

I guess we must decide which is which and who is my homey swicharoo! Arooh! A little Pink. 

How can I convey this? 

Is it goodbye my lover goodbye my pen lover?

I'm so hollow without you! 

How can I say that if the truth we’re known were bound together by super glue! Me and you!

P. S. Thankyou for reading thid  letter. Unsent in my phone. I want to say this to you! 

Just me yo yo yo yeah you! 

What the hell can I say! ☕☕

&lt;p&gt;How can I say? let me drink your tears up? Turn your hurt into laughter. Sharing together memories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I say. I miss our time together? Us two connected like missfitted puzzle pieces? Me and you a coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I say. your naked breasts lay bare in my head textually  your beautiful naked body on your keyboard making love. Us Two. Are you typing nude? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I say? I should lay my hands on you and make the night owl sing our song too. You and me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I say. textually we should be on the ruling planetary interlude amongst the online chatter? Us Knighted titans. We belong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I miss your textual laugh; hehe hehe! your patience with you slowly removing my heavy mask saw my ugliness I’m carrying  from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can I say? we talk it good really good! Lovers left on repeat. Just spit on me I’ll lick it up! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want all of you. Even your tattered and torn pieces. Will you take mine? You and me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all being there for you I would never let anyone hurt you I would make them respect you. Would you do the same for me. Yes no mabey?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can I say? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would delete anything I wrote for you.  Even if my backspace/delete was coffee struck. Would you swear at me and call me your dork.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes somewhere out there missing my mark in a crowded room of online desperatly  looking for you.  Hey, you yea you I love you! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My crow upon my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Us or them mentality probably &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess we must decide which is which and who is my homey swicharoo! Arooh! A little Pink. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it goodbye my lover goodbye my pen lover?&lt;/p&gt;

I want you, and only you

"Do you remember me beyond ""that weird guy from class""? Do you remember that day? It should have been a nice moment, not the beginning of love. Do you remember the flirting and the smiling? Do you remember the accidental happiness? How many days like that did your neurotypical life have? Do I even rank in the top ten?

You were my first successful flirting with a girl, made more special, because you were someone I knew and respected. And you liked me. You enjoyed it as much as I did. Then, I was gone, 250 miles away. You should have been the first of many. Instead, you were the best ever. You still are.

I can't lose you. I won't let myself lose you. You are love and peace and happiness. You are everything I have ever wanted.

The pain is fading, and I hate that. The pain is proof I succeeded. The pain reminds me of you. I don't know if it's the antidepressants or I'm getting used to it. Probably both. I cling to the pain, bury myself in it. I need to remember you're there. I need the agony.

I am in love with you.

Over and over again. I say it; I feel it; I prove it to myself.

I am in love with you.

Please.

I am in love with you.

I reached out to you in the least intrusive way I could. I don't expect much from it. ""Doing fine. Thanks for asking. Hope you're well."" But it keeps the dream alive. I can survive a little longer with you in my mind. The fantasies are becoming repetitious, but they are all I have. I will make you a habit if I must. I will hold on until my last breath.

I'm sorry for the melodrama, but depression amplifies everything. Better too much than nothing at all.

I love you.

"We were the exception to the rule. When potential suitors labeled being friends with your ex as a “red flag,” we just smiled because we knew our story was different.

And then in an instant, I became disposable. Our strong foundation built over years of trust and mutual vulnerability collapsed suddenly, and this time, neither of us rushed to try and stop the bleeding.

Now I’m forced to rewrite our story. There is no longer a fairytale ending where we exist in each other’s future. We no longer get to be the ex’s that defied the laws of the universe and remained best friends after heartbreak. Our narrative has changed and that’s okay too.

"My dearest Clyde,
I dreamt of you again last night. The excitement and rush pulsated through my body like kilowatts from the rain. All it took was a single glance from you. Across the tavern as we collected wallets from the patrons. Your gaze is enough to scare the bravest of men from challenging you in a dual. Yet soft enough to let me know I'm the only one you see. 
In my dreams I awoke to your hands exploring the depths of my being. Your lips giving way to your eager tongue. I lay there helpless under your body, arching my back towards the stars. I moan. My body begging for the satisfaction of all that is you. To feel you. Thrusting with fervor. Both sweating and insatiable. Discovering every fantasized deed of your dirty dreams. Frutating them to reality. The only thing holy is my moan ""oh God"".

You take my breath away gently erotically you sway back n forth to the music on the old gramophone playing ""Black Coffee"" (Ella Fitzgerald) Inviting me into your inner space we are one! Dancing on the silhouette. 

 

So sexy kissing swaying to Peg n Stella,

You came down I'm hard Bonnie, I don't want to get off too early. Patience had its rewards. You begin pulling slowly, my pants down. Grabbing my specspecialu begin to gently kiss just my tip then you showed me your best licking and sucking oh lord, begging you to stop! You wanted me in you. I wanted a soul flesh to like with you, my girl. Taking extra time to mouth you, arched up screaming llike a howling wolf! Then you sat on my face rocking back and forth and cum on my face! You tasted fruity hood  my cherry pie.

I entered your domain and lost, sex on repeat till daybreak! You are amazing my tittie sweet, then we made out verballyy till noon. It was easy, being with you my Bonnie girl. We stole each other's hearts, we villains. On the run always let's get it on then do another heist! A big one let's make history. Too bad we can't get Anne Ms. Sharpie to help.

"Under the Moonlight, my trombone slid glimmering moving up and down.

First to the seventh a real slide. 

Switch the positions for you can't go to ninth not there and back to sixth to reach your halfway point. That special number is just not there.

First position in slowly.

Third gentle sex with you.

Fourth, you ring my bell. 

Sixth can sound like first; I don't want to be a cheat! You are still number one. We're always close friends you have my back jack I thank you for that!

The second position is not for you.

With faith, it's late let's begin to acquiesce. 

Seventh extracurricular sex. 

Trombone bones don't make a poem you sure?

Let me make you and me on a declaration crescendo make angels sing and demons weep.

After we rest we can do a repeat and delightful decrescendo till morning light. Embracing your sweaty flesh.

Can I play Sir Duke just for you?

Moonlight love sonata babe I'm quivering at gazing at you. You watching me with my slide moving for you. I love you! My sax girl. T

I lay there on a bail of hay under the moon. Wishing my lover to return to our secret cabin soon. Unable to lay inside without his embrace. The more I think about him, the more I can feel my wetness pool in anticipation. I caress my chest imagining his tongue bringing forth the hardness of my nipples. Lightly teasing them as if I could feel his breath under his sweet tongue. Pulling up my dress and exposing my ladyhood to the night sky. Feeling vulnerable as I do when surrendering beneath him. Moving my fingers down to envelope and caress the buttons only my lover knows. My legs shake like an earthquake shifting my inner tetanic plates. Moving me to yell his name. In response the coyotes howl in unison at the moon. Clyyyyyyde! Mmmmm! Cum for me darling.

He was drunk as a bum I didn't hack his back! I scolded him like a schoolboy!"" Nielson's look doesn't ever think of touching Bonnie 

My bowels have excreted your soul! I need a refill, I need you bonnie our hands are jointly one. You have the key to unlock my heart, when I arrive by night I want to lift your hands above our heads and kiss and tongue you, then dance with you naked in the dark.

Right now I can only wire my hands to you until our secret rendezvous. I want to lick you up and down until you cry stop; then carry you to our bed, gently lying you down taking the time, I want to dive into you. Then pleasure you pass your insincere cries to stop. I want to be yours, bunny girl. 

Then us troublemakers and imaginative hucksters will explore the roleplay fantasies will you teach me what you want? I would swim upstream and cream you! Bonnie finger yourself think of me. Our hands gently touching your butterfly. Gazing into your eyes your sexy quick sadistic grin Lucifer! I am in hell without you! Why can't we enjoy it all? 

Every time I think of our hands to get her as one. I grow weary of the clan. My tears were lost in the rain at the thought of you! Once denounced at our final state benediction our love memories will be lost in the rain. I love you Bonnie my one-winged crow feels like the knife blade of silly wheels in my head! You are mine! I will protect you! Nurture you! Love you! I would kill for your honor or dishonor! Bonnie...I'm your black yellow-eyed leopard watching you! Drowning in your love. Putting out the fires with gasoline! It's been so long since I've ravaged your sweaty body!

I read your message to me! My life is empty without you. Your my angel of that I am sure! My flower crow on my shoulder watching out for me lover. If I were standing in a crowd I could see your face. You are everything that I want to explore, you're beautiful! I want to Lick your belly button and go from there. When we make love heavens and angels smile, I see paradise in your eyes! You could make a demon cry too. Your breasts, your tender nipples, my place to lay my weary head my abode my home. Your heartbeat plays my songs, and when you whisper and bite my ear makes me want to devour you! Your breathy sexy words. Stop blowing In my ear you sexy sax! I'm tired of running! I'm at my resting place with you our flesh to flesh my butterfly in your arms! Oh, you're better than a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

"Bonnie 

I wanted to complete my version of our final chapter. oddly before reading your letter. This is so sad, I am truly sorry Bonnie for hearing of my friend Doc Holliday lying brave-faced up in the hospital bed. Doc telling his friend goodbye. I don't understand why we became so close. I want to read this again to complete the pattern of your inner demise. I've died thrice and been backstepped out of a freight lift. To a quick ride on the highway and back.
It's easy to understand trust, especially with social media filled with us two nutjobs. No pun aimed at. My queen bee has MS. Advanced physical disability. Along with constant unmanaged babble. She has advanced dementia. I have been caregiving for her. I love her but has been platonic. I can't stand to be alone, yet I numbed into you and especially you kept me going. I feel like a cheater never seeing you I have fallen for you.

I have two children who do not come to see me, they won't tell me why! I never held my first one-and-a-half grandbaby or laid eyes on him. Except manipulative pictures to torture in the worst way. My son and my daughter have done well because I thought I broke the cycle of abuse. Two of my younger brothers are dead they were good men that chased their dragon to hell. Murdered and cut up the other crushed In a thrift store bin. I got as I call it the doctor of the house of the rising sun. I am clean because I look forward to getting up at 3:00 am! US I don't want to lose a good relationship if I may. I love the laughter and discipline you have shown me. I feel compromised. I could take my ""prescriptions"" but then I can't feel or project in a humourous, serious, and truthfully loving way! I am a loner my back to the rain.

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to complete my version of our final chapter. oddly before reading your letter. This is so sad, I am truly sorry Bonnie for hearing of my friend Doc Holliday lying brave-faced up in the hospital bed. Doc telling his friend goodbye. I don&amp;#39;t understand why we became so close. I want to read this again to complete the pattern of your inner demise. I&amp;#39;ve died thrice and been backstepped out of a freight lift. To a quick ride on the highway and back.
It&amp;#39;s easy to understand trust, especially with social media filled with us two nutjobs. No pun aimed at. My queen bee has MS. Advanced physical disability. Along with constant unmanaged babble. She has advanced dementia. I have been caregiving for her. I love her but has been platonic. I can&amp;#39;t stand to be alone, yet I numbed into you and especially you kept me going. I feel like a cheater never seeing you I have fallen for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two children who do not come to see me, they won&amp;#39;t tell me why! I never held my first one-and-a-half grandbaby or laid eyes on him. Except manipulative pictures to torture in the worst way. My son and my daughter have done well because I thought I broke the cycle of abuse. Two of my younger brothers are dead they were good men that chased their dragon to hell. Murdered and cut up the other crushed In a thrift store bin. I got as I call it the doctor of the house of the rising sun. I am clean because I look forward to getting up at 3:00 am! US I don&amp;#39;t want to lose a good relationship if I may. I love the laughter and discipline you have shown me. I feel compromised. I could take my &amp;quot;prescriptions&amp;quot; but then I can&amp;#39;t feel or project in a humourous, serious, and truthfully loving way! I am a loner my back to the rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yo I want to re-read it again it sounds serious please don&amp;#39;t do the dirty deed if you must well. Also after reading this I would lose someone close.

"I'm here. The place I've chosen as my final resting. I hear the rain and the wind covering the street below. I have been suicidal for many years. Made foolish attempts. Even half successful but restored after medical intervention at the request of those who've found me not breathing. 
I wake up each day, more angrier than the last. Upset that I've woken up. Wishing the pain throughout my body from the leukemia would cease. I find a way to smile, joke, grin ear to ear through the pain. My way of ""fake it till I make it"".
I'm barely making it. 
So many people men and women, secretly and publicly, claim to love me. Romantically. They crave being close to me. Over the years I have been stalked, harassed, threatened, and even kidnapped by past dates, lovers, or friends. All in hopes to keep me near. 
I feel like a zoo animal. Fun to observe. Interesting to others. I'm aware I'm seen. I even tend to pine after attention just for the high of their laughs. 
After the zoo has closed and I'm alone, my thoughts return. It's hard to sleep. The nightmares plague me relentlessly. The way I was caged as a child. Hung, beaten, burned, sexually assaulted. I escaped as a teen. Wondered the harshest streets. The only thing that kept me alive was hate and anger. I remember the first time having a gun to my face. I was scared. I trembled. The third time, I grabbed the barrel. Pulled it to my forehead, looking him in the eyes. I begged him. Please fucking pull it! Pull the fucking trigger! He ran away calling me the crazy one. I didn't feel relieved. I was mad he was a coward. 
Even angrier that I had to live on. 
So many people have tried to take me in. Even as a youth. They try to show me love. Show me what is considered some type of normalcy. Until they figure out I am a wild animal that cannot be tame. 
I have been the one who has bitten the hand that feeds me, time and time again.
It wasn't until I had children of my own that changed me. I learned patience. I learned what true love really was. I was fearful they had to live in a world that I only knew as evil. I raised them to be free thinkers. Protected them. Loved them. Today they are nothing like me and I couldn't be prouder of the job I've done. 
Two of my children are biological. The rest I've brought in are young adults who've aged out of foster care. Youth eho have been displaced from their own homes for being LQBTQ+. 
When homeless as a teen. I would walk through the middle class and rich neighborhoods. Observing the people. A guy fixing things in an open garage. Families setting the table. Kids riding on bikes. The smell of a grill cooking. The sound of a lawn being freshly mowed. Wishing I was like them. Wishing I had a safe place to rest. With both eyes closed. 
I have helped over 25 kids over the past 12 years. So that they didn't have to feel as I once did. Trying to pay back the Karma wheel for all the bad I did after my escape. Taking what I felt the world owed me. I was selfish. 
I had dated and tried my hand at relationships. Toxic attracted toxic. They never lasted long. I thought I had loved and lossed. It wasn't until recent that I had truly loved. I called him sunshine. I'm allergic to the sun. A sensitivity from being locked in a basement room until my escape. Many years. Parts of me feel as if I didn't escape. That I died down there. That I'm living through some sort of hellish pergatory. He was different. He was like me. I felt it the moment my eyes met his. Our breakup was his fault. I wasn't always at my best. I couldn't handle not being loved completely by him. I know he deserved a better me. Yet, I also deserved not to be cheated on. He broke me. Cut my heart to pieces and threw me out like trash. I'm broken. 
I wonder why I can easily mend others but not myself. I let this disease take me over instead of fighting. I have no fight left in me. I'm tired. I'm ready to sleep. The deep sleep. To finally be at rest. To return to the cosmos and be stardust. I want my inner light to burn peacefully. To guide the broken from above. 
I was going to post a last letter to him. I decided to write you. Someone I don't know instead. I had a friend set up a last face to face with him. So I could see him one last time. I walked away teary eyed. He seemed good. Happy. I knew then that I again was not wanted, nor needed. He told my friend after I left that it was the closure he needed. So I let it be just that. Closure. Who am I to disrupt the heart of the one, who was the one for me. I left knowing, I needed to let him go. The heart may want what it wants, but it may not deserve it. 
So, here I am. Putting my own final wishes in place. Making sure I've dotted the I's, and crossed my T's. 
Ensuring that my last days are spent tying up loose ends. 
I can't escape myself. The things in my head. Running away physically never helped the damage that was instilled and indoctrinated from the time I was born. I hate myself. 
Always searching for a partner in crime. The one who I can be my real self with. The one who would love me regardless of the ugly truth I bare. Someone who doesn't think I'm crazy for thinking *Natural Born Killers* is the most romantic movie ever made. 
Seems unlikely to me. 🤷😅 Thanks for caring.

You cast a love spell I wake up at the sexy thought of a real touch of us lip to lip. 

You are colorful magnificent and arrogant. You carry me on your wings Bonnie butterfly! I look higher in the sky to see your bountiful spicy attitude. All others compared to you are houseflies. The termites are wanting to lounge on my deck, but they can't. It's you I desire both of us sitting in cheap lawn chairs throwing roasted peanuts at each other. It's stupid but I would trade my life to be next to you. I don't know what I'm to say I want you to take on me! I'll be gone in a day or two.

"It is time that I let it all go. Let it all go and let you go Q.

You are married! You are married although you were less than truthful but your high handed and dismissive tone makes, made me both suspicious and angry. There are ways and ways but you chose a certain path.

Is my own fault in a way, I should have been relatively clear eyed but they say if not love then infatuations can be blind. Somehow in my mind a possible arrangement became a mild infatuation. 

Way in which you handled it was crass but then beauty can breed arrogance eh- beauty breeds confidence, lots of interested men can breed arrogance. Combine that with your polish and it's not hard to see how ""Oh another one not up to standard- bye then""!

I won't rake over old ground in terms of the substance of the matters at hand but yes you could have done better! I know I could in a great many ways.

I'd like to buy you a drink or a coffee some day, purely platonic and a final chat if the chance arose- perhaps even some day be on friendly terms.

You would perhaps beg to differ there and any drink of any kind purchased by me for you would be ""accidentally"" deposited onto me! 🤣🤐 However though I suspect I fecked that one too, some kinda friendlyish encounter PLATONIC and nothing else wouldn't be for me the worst thing of all time.

Yeah I screwed the aftermath, you were high handed and talked AT me rather than to me in some kinda discussion online. I would be lying if I said revenge ideas haven't crossed my mind in the last 6 months but my bark is mostly worse than my bite. 😎

It hurt for a while however I still will frequent BANK, Totterdown so thank you for at least introducing me to that venue.

In terms of a bit more detail as to the hurt, I actually stood and leant on that bridge that ia there, as one goes into Totterdown. You'll know it- it is enroute to BANK- never would I have jumped but I certainly leant and pondered- this would have been during July or August 2022 during that mega heatwave.

My Bonnie,

How I wish you were here. Our lives seem left on repeat. I dreamed of you again last night you were outta site! We were dancing on the blackest night under a bouquet of stars. Just the two of us bare feet the warm 
summertime grass beneath our feet. 

We embraced kissing and dancing in the dark two roughnecks singing to each other. I'll never forget the light in your fiery eyes gazing passionately into mine. I miss you. You are my treasure I keep locked in my dresser until I can hold you.

Remember when I said I would tie some string around your finger to make you mine? Don't you forget about me! I'm sorry, I was searching my heart! I look at my office wall there my love for you still hangs your wedding string in a place of my hardware store ""Vince Van"" the echoes of its frame etched in the paint; around your stretched-out ring. Sorting throughout my, empty nomadic heart your beautiful!  My fishbowl is an empty soul, Bonnie can you fill it whole? I belong to you, hope you feel better soon love. I will come for you I hope I'm not too late! My lassie of prose? Ever seen Manchester fields?
On the run so undone.

"Hi, 
Immediatly my heart speeds up, was that a hint? Do you like me? I mean more than just friends? 
Because you know I lay in bed thinking of you. 
I close my eyes imagine your face, would you smile at me?
I imagine us talking and unconsciously our hands intertwined and our fingers dance lazily. We talk and laugh.
It doesn't sound as much, but it would be the best.
Sometimes I dare to imagine that we kiss and you pull me into your warm embrace and tell me that you love me.
But I don't deserve any of this.
I shouldn't even think about it.
I am not the one, that someone falls for, especially not someone like you.
The fact that we are friends is more than I could ever dream of and I'm happy if I can at least make you smile with a little text.
I want to tell you, that I think of you all the time. But could you doubt, while receiving texts all through the day.
I know, you don't feel the same.
And it is okay.
If I can make your day better a little bit, that's all I can wish for.
But you are so unbelievable special to me.
Thanks for being in my life.

My Lady Freyja,

I have ridden the cliffs of the Irish shores, and I have walked the fields of Britannia. But nothing of their nature holds me like the wonder of your emerald eyes.

"I miss our time together, your voice your love honey. I hurt when you hurt, you tell me your problems and fears I listen! When I was dope sick you loved me I didn't want to talk. You've been there for me patient as Job!

Instead of breaking my heart you picked it up piece by piece and put it together!

 
I'm head over heels in love with you! I'm saying it again! I'm head over heels in love with you! I'm your protector stay close to my side no one will hurt you! Take that to the bank! The others that hurt you I will deal with them! Not to worry they won't try! I want to run away with you! Explore caves and islands drink lemonade and laugh! Take you from this bad place! Let's make a home.


Like a delight in precious metal, you have melted your heart into mine! That's you and me, melted in love! If you are scared to be touched, I'm so sorry I will wait till the end of time! Should you trust me say yes and ill be there. Feel safe, I will caress you gently kiss your ear lobes, and gently kiss the nape of your neck! We together love enjoyment, and ecstasy that's for you and me! Oh lord! Yes!

"I want to hold you in my arms  
I want to be held in your arms  
Lose myself in your embrace

I want to swim in your deep brown eyes  
I want to open the windows of my soul to you  
See your beautiful smile again

I want to smell your perfume in my beard and hands again  
Have you smell my neck, instant goosebumps  
That day FOREVER etched in my memory bank of happy moments

I love how we have so many things in common  
I love how we have the same view on so many aspects of life  
We are cut from the same cloth

I want to tell you everything  
I want you to tell me everything  
Never before have I ever shared my innermost, vulnerable, self like I could with you  
I love how you listen, without judging  
I love how you carry yourself, how caring and nurturing you are, how you notice the small things, and remember the likes and other details of those close to you

I also love how you have, over time, allowed me to take a look at the real you behind that brave face you put on daily. I see the pain, the sorrow, the insecurity and want you to know, it’s OK, you are OK, you will be OK.   
You are good enough. You are beautiful, a sight for sore eyes. I like you just the way you are!!

I look forward to the next opportunity where we can just spend time together, uninterrupted  
Talking for hours on end, forgetting about the fact that life has a cruel and twisted sense of humour, one day this will also pass…

You are the warm rays of the sun on my face, I cherish every moment, every secret glance, every message, every call.   
You.are.worth.it.

Be my valentine!",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-02-13T19:06:40.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to hold you in my arms&lt;br/&gt;
I want to be held in your arms&lt;br/&gt;
Lose myself in your embrace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to swim in your deep brown eyes&lt;br/&gt;
I want to open the windows of my soul to you&lt;br/&gt;
See your beautiful smile again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to smell your perfume in my beard and hands again&lt;br/&gt;
Have you smell my neck, instant goosebumps&lt;br/&gt;
That day FOREVER etched in my memory bank of happy moments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love how we have so many things in common&lt;br/&gt;
I love how we have the same view on so many aspects of life&lt;br/&gt;
We are cut from the same cloth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to tell you everything&lt;br/&gt;
I want you to tell me everything&lt;br/&gt;
Never before have I ever shared my innermost, vulnerable, self like I could with you&lt;br/&gt;
I love how you listen, without judging&lt;br/&gt;
I love how you carry yourself, how caring and nurturing you are, how you notice the small things, and remember the likes and other details of those close to you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love how you have, over time, allowed me to take a look at the real you behind that brave face you put on daily. I see the pain, the sorrow, the insecurity and want you to know, it’s OK, you are OK, you will be OK.&lt;br/&gt;
You are good enough. You are beautiful, a sight for sore eyes. I like you just the way you are!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to the next opportunity where we can just spend time together, uninterrupted&lt;br/&gt;
Talking for hours on end, forgetting about the fact that life has a cruel and twisted sense of humour, one day this will also pass…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are the warm rays of the sun on my face, I cherish every moment, every secret glance, every message, every call.&lt;br/&gt;
You.are.worth.it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be my valentine!&lt;/p&gt;

"You have the best smile. That's what did it to me. I didn't notice it when you think. We had that test: ""Read all of the directions before beginning."" Only you and your best friend did it right. I knew what it said and ignored it. I don't know if that was the ADHD or being a boy. Girls tend to pass the test more often. Either way, I plunged into the idiotic directions. One of them had us write something on the blackboard. The whole class was up there except you two. You just sat and smiled at us.

I should have had a crush on you then. I was an idiot. You were already pretty and getting prettier every day, but I didn't notice. How could I not notice a smile like that? Open and genuine and beautiful. God, you're beautiful. I want to see that smile again. I want to see you smile at me again like you did in church when you gave me butterflies. I felt that, over and over, every time I recalled that memory. Of course, I fell in love with you. I fell in love with the best smile ever.

When they wanted to fire our teacher, you and your friend led the charge to the principal's office to save him. You were almost in tears over it, seeing someone around you being hurt. I respected you for that, which is an odd response for a twelve-year-old, but there you are. I should have had a crush on you then. I didn't know what really mattered, and I hate myself for that.

And, your life since then; social work, education, charities. Jesus Christ, how much better can you get? How could I fall in love with you? How could I not?

God, I want to hold you. I want to tell you I love you. I want to say it to your face; I want to shout it to the world; I want to whisper it in your ear. I want you to smile when I say it, and I want to hear the words back. I want to kiss those lips and everything else. I want you safe and happy in my arms.

But, I can't.

I can't have what I want or say what I want or feel what I want. It's not allowed.

I'm sorry, if you see this. I want you to know that. I'm sorry for the drama, for the intrusion, for the effect, if any, this has on your life. I'm sorry for all I've thought and said. It's therapy. I've said that before. It's probably not healthy, but it's all I have. I can't lose you from my mind. I can't go back to what I was. You can't understand that. Nothingness is a thousand times worse. I know the chance will never come, but the hope keeps my head above the water.

I am not sorry I love you. I will never be sorry for that. I picked the very best.

If you see this, don't hate me, and don't pity me. I couldn't survive either. Try to understand. That's all I can ask.

As always, I love you.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-02-12T21:20:50.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have the best smile. That&amp;#39;s what did it to me.

"I went square dancing at a church and then bowling with coworkers last night. I received a book called ""God Winks on Love"" Let the Power of Coincidence Lead You To Love, by; Squire Rushnell... My coworker is very touched by my encounter with her in life. We met at work of all places and she has helped me in many ways because of our conversations about life, death and God. 

Another coworker tells me about the chapters she reads in the Bible every morning, i make sure to ask her every day we prep together in the kitchen. I love her wisdom and the stories she tells with her sassy attitude make it even more entertaining. It brings the Bible ALIVE to me. I love working with my family. I found a place I belong, everyone really does care about working together and helping each other. We check on each other outside of work. I've never had that before, not even when I was a teacher.... People are very secluded at work. Then my retail job, I feel like I live there! Everyone I worked with for 6 years now. We are family too! I've had many conversations about God with many teenagers that take a seasonal job with us and then leave for college. 

6 Years now.... It feels like yesterday when I met everyone and the memories we've shared together. I never thought with very mundane jobs, I've learned the most about life and how to enjoy the small moments. The small interactions with people do make a difference. Especially can change the outcome of someone's whole day, depending on how you both treat each other or how you speak towards them in a welcoming tone of voice....

When I'm tired, I'm guilty of not trying hard enough. But I do catch myself more often changing how I approach a person or situation. I can also help change someone from being upset to calm by asking casual questions or making a joke. I tend to have customers tell me about their personal life... I know I'm not the only cashier that may say that, but I really have noticed, even when I'm putting stuff away and trying to avoid customers asking me dumb questions. They find me in a far corner and still ask me ""DO YOU WORK HERE?!?"" 

I hate it so much!!!!!! Argh.... Yeah, duh, I work here, or I wouldn't be doing this.... I never say that, but I think it in my head and that causes me to not have a very nice response back to them. I sound annoyed and I've caught that too! lol..... Hey! DON'T JUDGE! XD

Well, I look back at all of this and realized that what we say and how we say things really DO MATTER! Like when I taught my students in music each class, we had to go over our classroom expectations. One of them was ""THUMPER"" from Bambi.... 

""If you can't say something nice, Don't say nothing at all.""

Well, dreams can come true in places you least expect it. I told Phil, I want a job that I can sustain myself, work together with others and enjoy what I do. I wake up, I look forward to what I do and I know I am touching other people's lives at the same time. Because, each interaction I have with someone, every conversation is something rich and resourceful to my growth. My inner child is LETTING GO of my past. My TRUAMA is releasing and I can't stop dancing around at work.... I annoy everyone around me. They sometimes ask me to stop singing, but I have so much LOVE FOR GOD inside of me. I can't hold it in. I'm so HAPPY! I have a few people in my past that are trying to stop me from accomplishing my goals and sharing my gifts, my intuitive gifts. That I can ""automatic write"" and connect to the other side.... I know this and I'm not afraid to speak out and share my truth with the world.

I fell in love with someone that wore a mask when he was with me. He told me things and false promises to string me along. I was wrong in my shortcoming within this relationship and I never thought I had enough time to even start to prove myself to him, that I loved him. He broke it off with me before I even had the chance..... I'm so regretful, but I've been told by my intuition and Suz before I ever met this man, how I was going to meet him and also lose contact with him.

She told me in confidence when he said in a text message,

""It is what it is""

He just left me in the cold. Confused to all hell, why he can't even talk in person or tell me why. He just changed his mind. Suz looked further into his life and that he is keeping a secret from me that he had a previous family and he is also bisexual.... This woman he is with is practicing witchcraft with him and they were trying to do something.... There is also a baby involved, but that was it and he has a dark side to him.

Well, this man also said he had something dark about him and will take a secret with him to his grave. There was a boy in his life he told me wasn't his child. His mother also immediaetley became friends with me on FB and I saw that we share the same birthday... The more I dated this man, the more she changed her profile picture and colored her hair to be brunette. She still didn't want me to be around this child, and I just thought it was even weirder that this guy kept a room full of pictures of this baby from ultrasound, going on vacation together to Disney land from floor to ceiling. This woman who tells me she is looking out for him as a friend and doesn't want to see him hurt.... Why did accept her invitation? 

I never felt normal when I was around this guy, there was something about them.... I never could put a finger on it. 

I've been told to practice tarot intuitively. I went to a shop and learned protection spells and letting go of the past journaling techniques. I'm becoming more intuitive because I'm doing this. I've been told by Phil, that I was a very spiritual person in a past life or even a healer.... 

Well, my gifts are coming to fruition. I have plenty of people witness what I can do.  I love myself so unconditionally, that I am becoming aware of information that I never knew I could grasp.... I'm finding youtube videos that explain my life with this man to the very detail....

Why was I led to watch it randomly, when it never interested me before?

Why when I practice and watch a video, the same cards fly out of my deck? Why do they speak of Me being a Sag and him being a Taurus connected to another Sag?!?! H's... Mom!?

Why is this about twin flame and a taurus/sag practicing magick to keep me from finding my real DM?

Why is this man invading my dreams, thoughts, every day life, synchronicities are annoying. I am taking pictures and videos of everything!!!! I have proof!!!!!

I'm in a loving form, and I'm doing what I love right now. I'm writing about my experiences with God, people around me and letting go of my past....

I'm not using your name right now, but I'm letting you know that I'm protected and I have a large spiritual family watching over me. To everyone back in my Home State; I walked away, so I can grow into the person I am today. I learned more about life because I lived through the PAIN! 

I can't change what I may have done wrong in the past, but I'm working on myself and choosing a better path than the one I was walking. God has that gift to forgive and allow us as many chances as we need with each day we are blessed enough to wake up too. 

I can help others overcome their pain through my story. I'm not afraid to speak my truth!

 I'm not afraid to never know your truth.... I'm sure that I already do, and I am letting you go from my life now. I spiritually cut all ties to your soul (E). I may love you from afar, but I love myself more to walk away never hearing another word from you again....

BTW, Stop stalking me on YOUTUBE! STOP CALLING ME WITH PRIVATE NUMBERS! 

Tina, 

Now, I'm off to practice a song I played in Pep Band 2013......

&lt;p&gt;Why is this man invading my dreams, thoughts, every day life, synchronicities are annoying. I am taking pictures and videos of everything!!!! I have proof!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in a loving form, and I&amp;#39;m doing what I love right now. I&amp;#39;m writing about my experiences with God, people around me and letting go of my past....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not using your name right now, but I&amp;#39;m letting you know that I&amp;#39;m protected and I have a large spiritual family watching over me. To everyone back in my Home State; I walked away, so I can grow into the person I am today. I learned more about life because I lived through the PAIN! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t change what I may have done wrong in the past, but I&amp;#39;m working on myself and choosing a better path than the one I was walking. God has that gift to forgive and allow us as many chances as we need with each day we are blessed enough to wake up too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can help others overcome their pain through my story. I&amp;#39;m not afraid to speak my truth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not afraid to never know your truth.... I&amp;#39;m sure that I already do, and I am letting you go from my life now. I spiritually cut all ties to your soul (E). I may love you from afar, but I love myself more to walk away never hearing another word from you again....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW, Stop stalking me on YOUTUBE! STOP CALLING ME WITH PRIVATE NUMBERS! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I&amp;#39;m off to practice a song I played in Pep Band 2013...... &lt;/p&gt;

"Since you walked into my life, everything has changed. You brought life to my plain existence. You showed me I can go further and be me, fully and shamelessly.

The world I want so badly to live in is the one you introduced me to. I thought I knew where I was going and how to navigate it, but the truth is, I never knew how beautiful it really was until you presented it to me. 

You set me free of my limitations and fears, made me face them all so I could finally embrace my personality and my purpose in life. You know what I’m talking about.

My desires, my burning physical needs were never this compelling. I would even say overwhelming, and they’re all toward you. My steamy thoughts, my urges, my wettest dreams, they’re all about you, about us becoming one, living the otherworldly experiences we so many times talked about.  

Despite your reluctance to listen to me when I tell you, you are the most special human being who ever walked into my life and my heart aches each time I think I might lose you forever. 

Maybe it’s all my fault. I am clumsy and I have a twisted way to ask for attention. I have this difficulty with accepting love. I know it’s confusing. I was never truly loved, it was my first time dealing with it. For some reason, I’m always skeptical, asking myself why would anyone love me. Deep down I don’t believe I deserve it, so I say and do stupid things. 

I am sorry. I’m sorry I hurt you, the only person who genuinely understands me, the only one who’s ever loved me so purely and so intensely. You never deserved the things I put you through. 

You are the most handsome man I’ve ever seen and the most beautiful soul I know. I am lucky you allowed me into your life. 

I will forever be grateful for everything I learn from you. About the world that brought us close, about myself, about relationships, loyalty, respect, partnership and so much more. Details I can’t disclose here because I know how much of a private person you are, but hopefully, you know what I mean. 

You’re the only one I trust with my life. You are the man of my dreams, the love of my life. Every experience with you is gonna feel not only like my first but also like my last. I don’t want to live them with anyone else but you. 

I want you to know how much I love you, deeply and intensely. You take all the room in my heart and mind, there is no one else but you. I live you and I breathe you 24/7. 

This is your love letter and I really hope you can appreciate it but please notice, it’s nothing compared to what I could give you if you’d just give me a chance.

I will always love you, MJ",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-02-12T20:44:33.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since you walked into my life, everything has changed.

I strolled out in my white t-shirt, my tight blue jeans, what the hell? Strutting myself before him? 
Am I gay? WTF what hells wrong with me? Was he gay? Oh, fuck the unpardonable I had a hard on! I walked across the street to meet him, butterflies in my stomach. Would he kick my ass? Oh lord! Then the moment truth I said Hi! 

Then would you know his girlfriend brought him a lemonade! Fuck, Fuck, Fuck! what this hell still think of him to this day! I am so in love but who? Now I have come out of my closet it was fighting to admit I am Bi! I wanted sex but I also wanted love. Could it be? Who am I bi, straight?

"My love, 
Since you left all i think about it you.  
No, it was like that before, it’s just so much more painful, now that you’re gone.  

I lay on the bed and imagine you next to me.  
Your smell, your touch, your voice, your hair touching mine as we look at eachother,    
My arms and legs tangled with yours.    
Sometimes, i can almost see you, if i try.  
Hear the vibrations of your voice in my ear, the way it rumbles and rings and rises and falls.  

It’s like music.  

I imagine your teeth flashing as you smile at me in the night, like pearls every so slightly crooked  
The taste of you as our legs tangle on that stupid pipe  

I promised you i would commit you to paper,  
Find a way to wrap your image, your legacy, on to one page  
I imagine the brushstrokes it would take, to make you real again. With me again.   
It would never cover all of you, never capture all of you  
You are so glorious you could not possibly be contained within a mere piece of art,  

I imagine the strokes it would take.

I miss our movies and gnocchi, the taste of parmesan and tomato red, the malleable pasta that sinks as i push down on it with my tongue.

I miss your music, our late night car rides and donut holes and cherry pie,  
Discount grocery store hot bars,   
deceptively charged by the pound.  

I miss the Friday center and the woods behind the library, did I ever take you to Caffé Driadé?    
It’s the best place to study. They have the smoothest coffee.    

I miss your bed full of blahaj and eurypterid and hermaphroditus,
I have a painting of you inspired by their sculpture.  
I miss your obnoxiously loud fan  
I miss lying in it with your purple light and laughing harder and smiling wider than I ever had since I was a child.  

I miss the feel of you.  
Of pressing my lips to your forehead and brushing your hair back and calling you mine.    
The feeling as our fingers slip together,  
Laughing as I tell you you aren’t allowed to let  
Go.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-02-05T20:04:05.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My love,

To My Love, Our Twilight

 

Death is a state in which the memories of those gone live on. As we stay living, we remember the embrace of our first kiss, the mortal emotional suffering. What will our friends say of it? What contributions did we make? Most importantly whose lives did we touch? Have we met love, or were we denied the pleasures of the flesh? In fear of judgment from our creator the inner essence of spiritual soul binding, the flesh the happiness of knowing we made our mark on others' lives! 

 

Atheist, and agnostic Christians, Shaman, Witches, we have a fear of the unknowns in the wind or lust to dust love our wanting to be loved by another! At times we feel we are on a physiological love bust, on a "" highway to hell"" for some of us! Have you ever pondered or lived up to ponder the third last breath? Death can bring a sweet happy welcome to physical suffering and a fearful tearful goodbye. If you are thinking about doing the dirty deed, do not please do not. We will make it you and I broken machines we have so much to offer! Stay with me!

 

You are in another dimension in space where time does not exist! Relationships in troubled ending in happiness, lonely man that cried for love has as some! Senior citizens are young. An eternal playground! You are lying next to me, your perfect soft face gazing into my eyes, no need to rush, we have eternity! Yes. Remember when? Mortality pain loss love uncertainty fear lost in the Twilight Zone!” Says the man smoking a cigarette!

Intoxicate you and not smother you

Learn about the things that have hurt you

Feel your pain with you while we heal

Support you in anything you want to do

Allow you the freedom to figure out what those things are

I will give you space

A safe place

To rest your head

I will believe in you because I know the sky is the limit for you in anything you want

I will put all of my love and power behind you

I will be in your corner 

I won't let anyone hurt you

You will never have to question my loyalty

I will show you the ultimate respect always

I will overflow with love and pride watching you slaughter it in your career

I will fuck you on your lunch break just to spice up your day

Make love to you until the sun comes up

And then cook you breakfast

I will never stop thinking of creative ways to show you how much I love you

I will be your divine feminine

Travel the world with you

Lay in your arms

Know I am truly safe

I will learn what it feels like to be loved

I will never stop staring at you and admiring your hotness

Kiss you until you make me stop

Pray for the chance to prove everything I just said

And I will consider your wants and needs with the same weight I give my own.  Always. 

And I won't be jealous of any other women.

"I write these letters to stop myself from contacting you. You're married, and I won't cross that line. I live in these fantasies, because they keep me sane, oddly enough. That's the writer part of me again. I've been keeping fantasy and reality separate for forty-three years, and I'm very good at it. Still, I have this idiotic idea that someone will read one of these things, recognize you, and tell you. I know it's impossible, but it tricks my subconscious into thinking I contacted you. Better that than really contacting you.

I can guess how you would react. You would think I was a stalker. I'm not. I've been thirty miles away from you for ten years, and I haven't gone near you. Stalkers don't respect distance or marriage vows. Even after I realized I was in love with you, I didn't go near you. It got bad a few times, at the lowest point of the depression, but I stopped myself. Mostly. I sent you that LinkedIn request, but you ignored it. That's probably for the best.

I've said this in previous posts, but I want to say it again; I did this to myself. You don't feel the same way. I know that. What happened was internal and mostly about Asperger's Syndrome. Your contribution ended forty years ago. You owe me nothing. Yes, I love you. Yes, I want to be with you, but I can't. I understand that. That's why I'm in therapy, why I want to start antidepressants. It is my problem, and I must deal with it.

I'm sure all of this is confusing. How could a memory do this to me? I know, from personal experience, if I can get oxytocin into my system, it will function normally. I know that from pets. Tactile interaction will release oxytocin. Hugging pets, holding them, wrestling with them, have all resulted in the formation of bonds. I have felt more grief over the death of a pet than the death of a family member. The Asperger's Syndrome prevents the release of oxytocin through non-verbal communication, but it does not stop the functioning of it if it is released. That's what that memory did, the ""self-soothing"" part of a self-soothing autobiographical memory. I released oxytocin and dopamine into my system every time I used that memory, hundreds of times over those forty years. They reinforced that memory and every other memory I have of you. They linked those memories to a positive sensation and created a sense of connection to you. The mechanism of oxytocin release was atypical; the process of falling in love was not.

I know how crazy that sounds. Believe me. I had to justify it to myself. That's life with Asperger's. I had to find the mechanism before I would accept my own emotions. I searched for references to this, but I couldn't find any. I asked for feedback on the theory, but no one responded. I found direct reference to the release of oxytocin and dopamine in response to a positive memory, but I couldn't find anything about this specific situation. Either I'm wrong about the theory, or I'm the first person to ever do this. You'd think the Asperger community would take notice. Most of us want this kind of connection, but no one else seems to care, not in the community or outside of it. I'm still not sure if the theory is right. I only have the emotion itself to go on. It is like nothing else I've ever felt and exactly what I think it should be.

I'm in love with you.

I say that a lot in these posts. I can't tell you directly, so I must say it here. You probably think it's just a crush. It's not. A crush (or limerence, if you're pretentious) is very immediate and very surface. It is quick to appear and quick to disappear, and it affects a different part of the brain. I've had crushes before. I did go to high school. None of them ever caused crippling depression. I have lost entire days to you.

It's not even the emotion, by the way. I don't have a support structure in place. I never felt love before. I don't know how to process it. The emotion itself, on a scale of one to ten, is probably a three or four. I'm not in therapy for the emotion. I'm in therapy, because I can't be with you. I am in therapy, because I found what I wanted my entire life, I found it with the person I wanted the most, and I can't tell you.

I hope you believe me, or at least believe the possibility. I know, if you did see this, you wouldn't respond. You have a family, and their safety must come first. If there is even a hint of doubt, you couldn't risk it, and there is a lot more than a hint in what I've said. Everything is correct, as far as I know it, but my word is obviously not enough.

This is why I fantasize about your divorce. I know only an idiot would divorce you, but it keeps me going on days when that's difficult. My happiness is contingent on your life being ruined. That's what I've become. I hate myself for it, but I hate the pain more. I hope, considering your background, that you'll understand that and hate me a little less.

I would be good to you, if I could. I mean that. I've said it in other posts; the emotion is very normal. I want to date you; I want to marry you; I want to be with you. I want a normal, healthy relationship. I don't fantasize about perfection and endless happiness. I fantasize about caring and contentment. And I fantasize about telling you.

I am in love with you.

You are the only love I have ever felt, and I will suffer agony to keep you. Forever and ever, if I must.

I will always be in love with you.

Please believe that. As hard as that is to do. Please. Believe me.

After your response post, I felt like I had betrayed your feelings! Starting as friends, you kept me alive at 3:00 am some of us get it, and some don’t!  I want to thank you for keeping me alive! I never really read unsent letters. Honestly, I am a romantic at heart. How could I have known you felt such feelings for me? I am sorry to say I am the fool in love here. I would never want to hurt you, as you have reminded me in your posts. Like your butterfly wanting to fly in the summertime sunshine with you! Your colorful attitude was everything to me. Hearing you push me away like I am some stalker creep a predator. You hurt me! Yes, I am infatuated with you! I feel like a butterfly that has been pinned through my heart for the enjoyment of others, I see you through my glass cage, freely flying alone while I smell the dead stale air. Nobody cares they just stare.

A reminder of what used to be. Juxtaposition we complement each other, I can't exist without the freedom of fluttering us two. The sun, the flowers, the grass. September came early this year when my heart was captured. I’m sorry that I am caged in the dark, is it your wish to fly without me?  Goodbye, sweet love!

"Haunted House Love

Honey, I have always wanted to send you this letter but never dared to do so.

 

When we were young in love, I wanted to ravage every inch of your untouched body! You were so special to me I was a broke cashless carney. I hated running the “Tilt A Whirl” how could that lame-ass ride be romantic? If you want to hurl on your lover great! Even at best the centrifugal force would keep my hands off your special spot!

Most rides I ran were stupid! I hated them!! I remember the night you visited my park mom dad and the band playing, the Merry Go Round, silly laughter abound then the assholes that like to spit from the sky tram! Sleaze bags! I chased their lame asses across the park to meet them at their point of destination, the other side of the park! I wanted to Kick some ass!

Before I could start on the jerks, I saw you beautiful, your mom and dad so oblivious to our eye contact! Devilishly I asked your parents if I could hold your hand offering a free ride! Our ride! We both wanted each other it was taboo forbidden we were young! Young lust or love probably both, wanting to be together but where? The funhouse is named appropriately, the problem is no privacy.

 How about the old Ferris the Wheel is too dangerous to tame I might scream! The haunted House? Dark a long, couple seater ride? Hell, I do not want to scare the hell out of my girlfriend, hopefully, my future wife. I could keep her safe from the fake monsters now and the monster unbeknownst to me lurking about in her future. A real creep!

Time rolls on years gone by remembering how we took each other in that little haunted car. You screamed my name not because you were scared you loved me!  I kissed every inch of your body. I always think about our undercover rendezvous love so many years ago. Every time Frankenstein shows up on late-night TV I cry, I miss you. 

I want to share this tawdry tale of lust and love before I g,o to be with you, who could understand? Me and you a young carnie making love making our future Lord knows above where you live! Wait for my love I am coming on the grandest ride of all to your arms, and to give you a gentle kiss holding hands. Some do not believe in heaven you are heaven! Here I come!

Funny how you view and experience things differently when you are in love…..

I have heard Shallow by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper multiple times. And I liked it, but not overly so. This past week for the first time I actually paid attention to the lyrics and, WOW, all of a sudden I am listening to this song in a completely different way. As if it was written with us in mind.

Funny how this song, to me at least, sums up what I have been feeling, and I believe you too, in some or other way?

**The lyrics:**

“Tell me somethin', girl  
Are you happy in this modern world?  
Or do you need more?  
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?

I'm falling  
In all the good times I find myself  
Longin' for change  
And in the bad times I fear myself

Tell me something, boy  
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?  
Or do you need more?  
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?

I'm falling  
In all the good times I find myself  
Longing for a change  
And in the bad times I fear myself

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in  
I'll never meet the ground  
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us  
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, sha-hallow  
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low  
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow  
We're far from the shallow now

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Whoa

I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in  
I'll never meet the ground  
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us  
We're far from the shallow now

In the sha-ha, shallow  
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low  
In the sha-ha, shallow  
We're far from the shallow now”

I will never again be able to listen to this song in the same way as before, and you…..?",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-02-04T15:31:00.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funny how you view and experience things differently when you are in love…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have heard Shallow by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper multiple times. And I liked it, but not overly so. This past week for the first time I actually paid attention to the lyrics and, WOW, all of a sudden I am listening to this song in a completely different way. As if it was written with us in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny how this song, to me at least, sums up what I have been feeling, and I believe you too, in some or other way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The lyrics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tell me somethin&amp;#39;, girl&lt;br/&gt;
Are you happy in this modern world?&lt;br/&gt;
Or do you need more?&lt;br/&gt;
Is there somethin&amp;#39; else you&amp;#39;re searchin&amp;#39; for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m falling&lt;br/&gt;
In all the good times I find myself&lt;br/&gt;
Longin&amp;#39; for change&lt;br/&gt;
And in the bad times I fear myself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me something, boy&lt;br/&gt;
Aren&amp;#39;t you tired tryin&amp;#39; to fill that void?&lt;br/&gt;
Or do you need more?&lt;br/&gt;
Ain&amp;#39;t it hard keeping it so hardcore?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m falling&lt;br/&gt;
In all the good times I find myself&lt;br/&gt;
Longing for a change&lt;br/&gt;
And in the bad times I fear myself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m off the deep end, watch as I dive in&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll never meet the ground&lt;br/&gt;
Crash through the surface, where they can&amp;#39;t hurt us&lt;br/&gt;
We&amp;#39;re far from the shallow now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sha-ha, sha-hallow&lt;br/&gt;
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low&lt;br/&gt;
In the sha-ha, sha-hallow&lt;br/&gt;
We&amp;#39;re far from the shallow now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh&lt;br/&gt;
Whoa&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m off the deep end, watch as I dive in&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;ll never meet the ground&lt;br/&gt;
Crash through the surface, where they can&amp;#39;t hurt us&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the sha-ha, shallow&lt;br/&gt;
In the sha-ha, sha-la-la-la-low&lt;br/&gt;
In the sha-ha, shallow&lt;br/&gt;
We&amp;#39;re far from the shallow now”&lt;/p&gt;

I have become nothing more than an object, she can't help it. I have found someone online I care about so much more. At first, it was a karma show. As time went on I realized it was something more! She can pull my heart from my chest and hold my life in her hands. Spiritually she holds my brain! The Reality says it's taboo, but is it? Complicated I have questioned my morality and my sexuality. I am in love but a married virgin has never been with another. I am deep down shy!/Are ]you yea you telling me to fuck off! I have been through dry spells with her can't say I blame her! Oh, what can I say do you want me to leave you? No matter your wish I will always love you! Your lips are like honey to me. You said my poetry ducks true. Together we are an item a commodity. You scare me I still care. So fuck off is what you want?  Then tell me one word only we crazies would know or a scenario. I will painfully walk away. I am sorry if I hurt you.

"Crush me. Take me into your palms like a small flower and crush me, preserving me for your eyes only to gaze upon. The flower that you gave me the day after my confession is currently preserved in between the pages of one of my textbooks. The flower sits there, alone, between words and knowledge, and its beauty reminds me of you. Passion flies out of your mouth all the time, and like a bee craving for nectar, I yearn for your knowledge. Where boldness flies out of me, confidence flies out of you. However, where my friends see you as brash and loud, you look at me with soft eyes and ask me to tell my stories. You sit silently while I speak, a smile on your lips that makes me nervous to the point that I forget what I am even saying. You don’t act like this around other people, only me. 

I guess I am writing this because our mutual friend asked me about you. About my feelings. I have to admit, I don’t like having them. I don’t like that when you’re in the room, it’s like two magnets that have been separated for too long, and suddenly we’re brushing against each other. Our eyes meet in crowded rooms, and the gaze is heated, and I don’t understand it. I simply don’t understand you. I don’t understand why it feels like a “forbidden lovers” situation when the only obstacle is my friends. You can easily read the room because your eyes seem to stare so intently at me, so you seem to understand this. I am on the edge of saying ‘fuck it’ and going to ask you on a date. However, they are my friends, and now I’m friends with your friends. But, at the end of the day, I might just ask you to do one thing tomorrow, when I’m drunk and in your vicinity:

Crush me. Take me into your palms, and mold me like putty. Do whatever you want with me. I’m consenting. I’m going crazy, and I think I almost threw a punch today trying to stand up for you.

Coincidence providence happenstance; I don't think so! With random precision, your letter pierced my heart! I think I  know who you are.

July we began our crazy journey together from cartwheels to wagon wheels. Laughing behind our screens and crying too.
Then an unspoken truth leaped from my screen.  I am bi I think confusion and uncertainty. Then the truth, I think that I love you, friend. Worried about how I would take the news! Being hetero no wonder the worry. I cried no no no!  It's you that I am in love with! 

Whether you decide you are bi doesn't matter to me. You were right at first I was hurt! Until you spoke those magical words ""I think I love you."" You are you! Remain in my arms, and come back to me! Until then you remain my dream yes even a wet one to me!

I love you just the way you are. without you a nightmare! Please the first item on my list is to make us breakfast and coffee, we can shop talk plan our future, then have an intimate talk, a gentle kiss that is if you still want me.

"I loved you so much. 

I wanted to give you everything and so I did. Even though I never understood why it was so hard for you to tell me your fears and your needs, I accepted that, even though it hurt me. Despite the pain I would’ve stayed with you through it all. But you left me. And now that you’re gone there’s nothing left of me. 

I don’t even recognize myself anymore. With each day that passes by I become more like you. People love me, they give me what I always thought I needed, but I feel nothing when they feel the most. I feel like I take it all, but give nothing in return. I feel like I drain them by merely being around them. I shut them out and become distant whenever my own life gets to much, because I’m scared of hurting them. I am scared of letting them know I’m scared and my fear inevitably hurts them. 

I know my numbness will eventually make the people around me feel like you made me feel. I know I will eventually hurt those I love the most. They will eventually be disappointed in me, for taking so much and giving so little. I will inevitably hurt them. Just like you did. I will break them and I will take the brightest pieces of them with me when I leave. Just like you did. You did this to me. You broke me. You took everything I had to give with you when you left me. 

And the worst thing is, I can’t even be angry with you anymore. 

Because I know how hard I try. I know that still I fail everytime, even though I try so hard. And I can’t help but think that you must’ve tried just as hard.

&lt;p&gt;And the worst thing is, I can’t even be angry with you anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I know how hard I try. I know that still I fail everytime, even though I try so hard. And I can’t help but think that you must’ve tried just as hard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell me, who was it? Who broke you, before you broke me?&lt;/p&gt;

Whether you decide you are bi doesn't matter to me. You were right at first I was hurt! Until you spoke those magical words ""I think I love you."" You are you! Remain in my arms, and come back to me! Until then you remain my dream yes even a wet one to me!

I love you just the way you are. without you a nightmare! Please the first item on my list is to make us breakfast and coffee, we can shop talk plan our future, then have an intimate talk, a gentle kiss that is if you still want me.

Sometimes we make them, sometimes we draw on them.

For the time being, we can draw on the memories we have managed to create up to now.  
All of the small moments leading up to the culmination of last week, you know, the ones we love to discuss and point out. Thinking of any of those bring a smile to my face, every time.   
Then we also have the memories of the three days leading up to that fatefull day, and of course we have that day when we laid it all on the table. The day our souls finally connected...

"More than two months in, and I can't stop. I'm sick of waiting. I should be with you by now. That's what runs through my head. Your smile, your laugh, your everything. But, I can't see you, I can't talk to you, I can't touch you. God, I want to touch you. I want to hold you and kiss you and whisper, ""I love you,"" into your ear. I want to wake you with those words every morning and send you to sleep with them every night. I want your body against mine, your head on my chest, snoring softly. I want warmth, I want contentment, I want you.

It's therapy, all this ranting, all this purging, all this pain. It's all I have. The pain is proof I succeeded. I love you. I shouldn't. I shouldn't be able to. Now that I have it, I don't want to lose it. The pain is all I will ever have. I know that. I will cling to that agony as I would cling to you. That memory was your first gift to me, the pain was the second gift, and I will cherish them both.

THIS IS SO FUCKING STUPID!

The idiocy of life and love, pleasure and pain, reward and punishment. For what? Neurotransmitters reinforce memories, program emotional responses, and direct behavior. I crossed two wires accidentally, and now my life revolves around someone who barely remembers me.

I am in love with you.

Because a neurotransmitter told me so.

You would be shocked if you found out, confused, suspicious, and rightly so. If you saw this, if you knew any of it, you'd probably call the cops on me. Weird doesn't begin to cover it. But, here I am.

I am in love with you.

Do you know what the craziest part is? You'll love this. I do. It's how fucking normal the emotion is. I fantasize about cooking dinner for your friends and taking yoga classes with you. I fantasize about the most boring shit possible. I fantasize about sitting on a couch with you and watching TV. No shit. All of the drama, all of the idiocy, all of the insanity that got me to where I am, and that's my dream ending.

I want to date you for a few months then propose to you.

I'm serious. I even have the speech planned. It's actually pretty good. Down on one knee, ring in hand, that's my fantasy. It's not rainbows and unicorns; it's dinner dates and exercise classes. That's why it hurts so much. I'm not crazy. I'm not dangerous.

I am in love with you.

In the most normal, stable, healthy way possible. You are not perfect, I know that, but you are wonderful. You are not everything, but you are everything to me. And I can't tell you. Ever.

I need to remind myself of that. I need to stop myself from finding you and blurting it out, ruining your day with my bullshit. But I can't stop thinking about it. You are the only thing in my life right now. I don't know if I want that to change. My life is on hold, but I don't want to lose you. Not even a little. It's not a perfect answer, but it's not a perfect life either. I will fight myself on your behalf for as long as I must. Good days and bad. Today was not that bad.

As always, I love you.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-02-01T02:25:12.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than two months in, and I can&amp;#39;t stop. I&amp;#39;m sick of waiting. I should be with you by now. That&amp;#39;s what runs through my head. Your smile, your laugh, your everything. But, I can&amp;#39;t see you, I can&amp;#39;t talk to you, I can&amp;#39;t touch you. God, I want to touch you. I want to hold you and kiss you and whisper, &amp;quot;I love you,&amp;quot; into your ear. I want to wake you with those words every morning and send you to sleep with them every night. I want your body against mine, your head on my chest, snoring softly. I want warmth, I want contentment, I want you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s therapy, all this ranting, all this purging, all this pain. It&amp;#39;s all I have. The pain is proof I succeeded. I love you. I shouldn&amp;#39;t. I shouldn&amp;#39;t be able to. Now that I have it, I don&amp;#39;t want to lose it. The pain is all I will ever have. I know that. I will cling to that agony as I would cling to you. That memory was your first gift to me, the pain was the second gift, and I will cherish them both.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THIS IS SO FUCKING STUPID!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idiocy of life and love, pleasure and pain, reward and punishment. For what? Neurotransmitters reinforce memories, program emotional responses, and direct behavior. I crossed two wires accidentally, and now my life revolves around someone who barely remembers me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because a neurotransmitter told me so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You would be shocked if you found out, confused, suspicious, and rightly so. If you saw this, if you knew any of it, you&amp;#39;d probably call the cops on me. Weird doesn&amp;#39;t begin to cover it. But, here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry for punctuation grammars and typos.

Spring 2019 i was working a handyman gig for a couple outside of town. I had done a lot of work for them, siding, drywall patches; basic household repairs. One day after kind of a b.s. call we finished up work had a good friend working with me, after collecting payment which was probably less than $100 I walked out the door, there I seen HER like nothing I've ever seen. Blue and white striped sun dress tattoos on legs arms,  strawberry blonde hair, writes that insidious rod the soul from my body. She was carrying her then 4 year old son, a handsome mama's boy. I nodded my head as she walked by.  As we got in my old tahoe kissed with tools I informed my Jared she was the one and I'd have her. 

After maybe 2 hours I recieve a message I had just got home finished the day. 

Paraphrasing- hey could you help me clean brush out of my yard? You work for my mom. I'm naturally shy and figure no way is what I think. I would love to when would you like me come by. Anytime ect. I  met with her the next day picked her used up she helped told her not to pay me. She insisted I said call it a 6er of Heineken.
She came off kind of shy at first. On my way home she messaged me and pretty said hey I'm interested are you and it began from their. 


I have 3 kids 1 with one 2 with another.
At the time I only had 2 1 with each.
The mother of my son now middle child had been drinking to the point of passi.g out drunk in her car down the road from the bar. We had had on going issue with this we had split up because of and were trying to figure things out make it work for our son. I'm sure my actions didn't help with what she was going thru on not an easy person to live with or be around for extended times. 
For privacy I'll use bm1 and bm2 from now on (baby mamma) 

Bm2 the drinker was dropping the kids off whilst I got the message from HER to have her yard picked up. After that I told bm2 I was done finished. I thought I found someone. Yes I knew already I wanted to be with HER. It was a whole deal of course how could yous I thoughts and why nots. To this day she continues to drink.
I didn't want to leave my son like that having experienced that previously it was hard but there's a point where the toxic relationship damages the kids. Off I embarked on the new path.


Part 2


Instantly we bonded she was former army mechanic had worked on missiles, trucks all kinds of stuff. I could and did tell her everything and felt comfortable in a way I never had before. The way she kissed and touched me, I could be me. An absolute fabulous mother. It wasn't a whole month she said the words and I returned them meaning every bit of it. Lunch and dinner dates, my oldest daughter started coming around more. My business was doing good growing. I was in the happiest period of my life. 

Still I think about HER. The sweet scent of HER hair, HER body was tight and smooth like a high end exotic car. I remember falling asleep on HER lap just staring into her eyes forgetting everything but the way she made me feel. 
She had recently moved from Florida, didn't know many people didn't know the area. We hiked, took the kids to the parks, she even helped me build a deck. Helped me paint bm1's house.  Absolutely perfect and irreplaceable in every way. 
After awhile bm2 began messaging begging me telling me she'll quit in done whatever it take never again. I'm a bad father for splitting up our family. We had been together awhile she knows some of my insecurities and how to get at me. 

As you may have guessed it's about to take a turn, I fucked it all up ruined it. HER was going to move in with HER mom and stepfather,  who were nice don't get me wrong but weird and not exactly my mind of people. A lot of drama between HER mom and stepfather. She was paying high rent was kind of in over her head and what she needed to do. I helped her paint her new bedroom at her parents and never seen HER again. 

Bm2 still messaging playing her games, I caved,  thinking about my son and having two different kids and not being with either mom. Made me feel shitty and still does.
After a long talk and  bad decisions, I had to tell HER.

Absolute worst feeling of my life breaking the love of my life's heart like that. She knew something was up after I helped HER paint Her new room. I was too big of a coward to face her like a man. After leaving I I ended texting her and telling her it wasn't a good idea she needed to do better, right away she called me out, a connection like we had there's no way she didn't know I was unfaithful. 

I've been broken near emotionless since.

Bm2 and I had another beautiful daughter, HER got remarried had few more kids. 

As of right now I just left bm2 for drinking and lying about it and us just not being compatible. We have maybe 4 good days a month. It's always a fight and stressful. Claims all I want is sex, the only thing we do together including sleeping eating ect. I invite her with me places try to to things always end in a fight. The only thing I want is something she can't give me. Affection, I miss the feeling of love the security HER gave me. 
 
As I jump off the boat again I'm swimming in hopes of finding land. 

KATE I will love and cherish the time I spent with you forever. I hope you're happy and you feel the way you made me feel once upon a time. If you ever read this I didn't deserve you, and I apologize I wish I was a better man that made better choices.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-01-30T04:36:53.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry for punctuation grammars and typos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spring 2019 i was working a handyman gig for a couple outside of town. I had done a lot of work for them, siding, drywall patches; basic household repairs. One day after kind of a b.s. call we finished up work had a good friend working with me, after collecting payment which was probably less than $100 I walked out the door, there I seen HER like nothing I&amp;#39;ve ever seen. Blue and white striped sun dress tattoos on legs arms,  strawberry blonde hair, writes that insidious rod the soul from my body. She was carrying her then 4 year old son, a handsome mama&amp;#39;s boy. I nodded my head as she walked by.  As we got in my old tahoe kissed with tools I informed my Jared she was the one and I&amp;#39;d have her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After maybe 2 hours I recieve a message I had just got home finished the day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paraphrasing- hey could you help me clean brush out of my yard? You work for my mom. I&amp;#39;m naturally shy and figure no way is what I think. I would love to when would you like me come by. Anytime ect. I  met with her the next day picked her used up she helped told her not to pay me. She insisted I said call it a 6er of Heineken.
She came off kind of shy at first. On my way home she messaged me and pretty said hey I&amp;#39;m interested are you and it began from their. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have 3 kids 1 with one 2 with another.
At the time I only had 2 1 with each.
The mother of my son now middle child had been drinking to the point of passi.g out drunk in her car down the road from the bar. We had had on going issue with this we had split up because of and were trying to figure things out make it work for our son. I&amp;#39;m sure my actions didn&amp;#39;t help with what she was going thru on not an easy person to live with or be around for extended times. 
For privacy I&amp;#39;ll use bm1 and bm2 from now on (baby mamma) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bm2 the drinker was dropping the kids off whilst I got the message from HER to have her yard picked up. After that I told bm2 I was done finished. I thought I found someone. Yes I knew already I wanted to be with HER. It was a whole deal of course how could yous I thoughts and why nots. To this day she continues to drink.
I didn&amp;#39;t want to leave my son like that having experienced that previously it was hard but there&amp;#39;s a point where the toxic relationship damages the kids. Off I embarked on the new path.&lt;/p&gt;

"Love,

Last night, I met you again for the first time. Our seven-year history carefully erased in your memory. You reached out to me, your arms around me, a friendly hug that contained so little of what you wanted from me years ago. Those first few days of breath and promise, the following years of molecular closeness, all fallen away like red leaves in the wake of your autumnal shift. What love we felt passed through the alchemy of your heart and emerged at a distance, my hand empty of yours.

Wanting you is easy. The rich wonder of your thoughts illuminated by your beauty, the way your words kindle into deeper fires, all clad in the golden ratio of your way. Even after all this time and this growing distance, my heart flares at your touch. My soul rises to meet even your smallest glance. My hand always hungry for yours. But how do I carry all of this now that you have told me a different story of our love?

When we met, you needed shelter from the storm of your life. You needed sustenance that had been denied you by your previous love. You needed someone to stand with you as you healed. And heal you did. And as you healed, the story of us began to change. The intimacy we shared changed timbre, the closeness we enjoyed yawned wide, wider still until you offered only passing words. My purpose was served. No matter how many times you told me that I was so important, so valued, so needed, the new story recast my role into ever-diminishing parts. Until finally, we are here.

We are not young, you and I. We weren't young all those years ago when we met. Our hearts are not so foolish as to ignore change, nor are we so struck by acts of love that we can't see beyond those borders. But here I am, writing you a letter you will never read, an old heart still so hungry for your moments, hungry for you entire. 

Last night, when you pulled me to you, a friendly hug full of warmth and recognition, I could feel the miles between our skin. Whatever joy we shared is trapped in your amber, a forever fossil to be remembered rather than kept.  An artifact of a time long passed. You have written a new story, one that doesn't need whatever it is you cultivated between us. Nor does it require you remember what I remember. So I met you again, in this strange place of distance, for the first time. Another you among many versions of you. And to my sadness, I fell in love with you again. As I always will. 

Perhaps in this late period of my life, your distance will grow vast enough for it to break whatever golden thread that still binds me to you. I have already wept enough but I believe when this last thread is pulled taut, when the snap sounds, and you are finally gone from me, what will be left is the shape of your love still carved into the walls of my life. A hollow that I have no more time to fill, a story that I was written out of. 

I will remember those first years with you, perhaps they will be food enough to ward away the starvation of time. And perhaps it is best to close this letter with one last truth.

I have loved you, I will love you, and even in this growing stillness I will keep the rooms you occupy in my heart open wide, your memory there still bright, a torch for you to look back on long after your memory of me fades.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-01-30T20:16:34.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love,&lt;/p&gt;

"I have something for you.

It’s important, but it’s not urgent. It arrives on quiet foot and is happy to sit by itself peacefully.

It comes from a warm place of deep gratitude, a golden place of admiration and gentle awe.

It brings with it no expectation, and arrives without demand or urgency or agenda.

It thrives in tiny precious memories of simple joy. Of noisy nights and quiet mornings, silly songs and red-faced hugs, of brave deep breaths to tightly grab hands behind your back, and in the still-baited breath of words written that should have been spoken.

It lingers in moments of pain; one-sided, shared, same-time but different-reasons, together but divided, separate but wishing for closeness… pain that helped me find the wisdom to do better, and the wish that I could have found it without bruising a gentle heart.

It settled in a place that knows we were following different maps, with a different X marking different treasure.

It’s shone in the joy of seeing you happy and thriving, even though that was somewhere else.

It warms a place that knows I’m better for our hearts having beat together than if they hadn’t.

It’s a gift that’s mine to give, yours to know you have, and somewhere in the middle it alone fully knows the ways that it is cherished.

But when it arrives, at last it looks you slowly and softly in the eyes, because it knows it’s too important to be a hasty note traced in the palm of your hand.

I’m very glad to have held it, and if you ever want to hear how it might sing, come and find me.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-01-29T13:11:07.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have something for you.&lt;/p&gt;

"For the longest time, as long as I can remember you was my best friend.Tthe person I was closest to, Hell we met when I was 6 months old when you was born. Even though we had different genders we was like best friends. In truth I have always loved you as more than a friend.

We grew up together, raised hell together, I played with your dolls and we named our doll Molly. You rode bikes and played video games with me. We was inseparable as kids even if we did argue occasionally.

We grew apart thanks to my situation at home and that was also around the same time you started liking ebony guys alot, and you started looking at me different. It made me jealous but there was other feelings I can't even describe, I was empty. 

I never have told you this but the way you stopped looking at me shattered my already broken pieces. You still don't know this but the reason my situation at home was so bad was due to a sexually abusive uncle who took me and other family members many times.
Again since you didn't and still don't know all this you don't know how the way you stopped looking at me registered to me in my mind.
 

I blamed your new found attraction and you took it as racism (it sorta was but not truly, I could never be that petty) it was just jealousy misdirected anger and a flood of emotion at feeling how distant we now was.

Due to the trauma from all of the stuff I went through I got addicted to porn and slowly withdrew into a shell where I just watched TV and played games while living life on autopilot, I wanted to come hang out with you but my mom kept me grounded for 6 months at a time. That really added to how distant we grew.

I watched you quietly occasionally and seen you with other guys. I never once intervened or acted any way but dignified to the people you was in a relationship with. 

I didn't mind letting you be yourself, experiment, live life and have fun at college without being tied down, so I waited till after. When you graduated college I asked you out finally and you turned me down. It broke my world apart. I truly did think we would get married one day and have a real Molly.

I was sad a first but then I seen how well your doing, where you are now and how happy you are... How can i not be be happy regardless what your doing, even if it doesn't involve me. Look at the smile and glow you have every time I see you.

We are still both single without kids and pushing 30.. I haven't lost all hope that one day you will be mine. But if I'm truly honest about something...

I dont think I'm good enough for you, I know you would never say or think that but I think it myself when I see how bad I'm doing compared to you. 

There are plenty of guys I get jealous of but when I stop and think about it rationally if the guy truly does love you as well and will treat you right I have to be happy. The guys you pull can support you financially in a way I never could, I'm the kinda bum I don't want near you.

You're like a goddess, perfect, always have been and your smart as hell to, that's why you got all them scholarships and grants to a university while I was only invited to but could not afford community college.

Your a special girl, alteast to me you are and honestly deserve everything you want. I will always be there if you need me to be. 

Even in the future, if we finally do get married to other people if my hypothetical future wife and me was to tell each other a movie star or something that would be ""the one who it's acceptable to cheat with"" you would be the one I named because even when we was watching those stars on TV my gauze drifted to your golden hair and blue eyes, you truly have always been radiant.

Tldr: I love you, always have and will but I think it's best if its from afar. Thank you for all the good times growing up. I hope you don't mind me saying but the food both smelled and tasted delicious, I bet it still does. I will always be grateful for it.

Also thank you for not treating me any different after I asked you out. I suspect you knew I had feelings already and was prepared for it, you might have even been dreading the day I finally did ask, If so I am sorry if it caused you any anxiety.

Again...

I do and always will love you.


- Forever and Always your Twisterfrog.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-02-01T01:28:45.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, as long as I can remember you was my best friend.Tthe person I was closest to, Hell we met when I was 6 months old when you was born. Even though we had different genders we was like best friends. In truth I have always loved you as more than a friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We grew up together, raised hell together, I played with your dolls and we named our doll Molly. You rode bikes and played video games with me. We was inseparable as kids even if we did argue occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We grew apart thanks to my situation at home and that was also around the same time you started liking ebony guys alot, and you started looking at me different. It made me jealous but there was other feelings I can&amp;#39;t even describe, I was empty. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never have told you this but the way you stopped looking at me shattered my already broken pieces. You still don&amp;#39;t know this but the reason my situation at home was so bad was due to a sexually abusive uncle who took me and other family members many times.
Again since you didn&amp;#39;t and still don&amp;#39;t know all this you don&amp;#39;t know how the way you stopped looking at me registered to me in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I blamed your new found attraction and you took it as racism (it sorta was but not truly, I could never be that petty) it was just jealousy misdirected anger and a flood of emotion at feeling how distant we now was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the trauma from all of the stuff I went through I got addicted to porn and slowly withdrew into a shell where I just watched TV and played games while living life on autopilot, I wanted to come hang out with you but my mom kept me grounded for 6 months at a time. That really added to how distant we grew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched you quietly occasionally and seen you with other guys. I never once intervened or acted any way but dignified to the people you was in a relationship with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t mind letting you be yourself, experiment, live life and have fun at college without being tied down, so I waited till after. When you graduated college I asked you out finally and you turned me down. It broke my world apart. I truly did think we would get married one day and have a real Molly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was sad a first but then I seen how well your doing, where you are now and how happy you are... How can i not be be happy regardless what your doing, even if it doesn&amp;#39;t involve me. Look at the smile and glow you have every time I see you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are still both single without kids and pushing 30.. I haven&amp;#39;t lost all hope that one day you will be mine. But if I&amp;#39;m truly honest about something...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dont think I&amp;#39;m good enough for you, I know you would never say or think that but I think it myself when I see how bad I&amp;#39;m doing compared to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of guys I get jealous of but when I stop and think about it rationally if the guy truly does love you as well and will treat you right I have to be happy. The guys you pull can support you financially in a way I never could, I&amp;#39;m the kinda bum I don&amp;#39;t want near you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re like a goddess, perfect, always have been and your smart as hell to, that&amp;#39;s why you got all them scholarships and grants to a university while I was only invited to but could not afford community college.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your a special girl, alteast to me you are and honestly deserve everything you want. I will always be there if you need me to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in the future, if we finally do get married to other people if my hypothetical future wife and me was to tell each other a movie star or something that would be &amp;quot;the one who it&amp;#39;s acceptable to cheat with&amp;quot; you would be the one I named because even when we was watching those stars on TV my gauze drifted to your golden hair and blue eyes, you truly have always been radiant.&lt;/p&gt;

"I fantasize about your divorce. I know what that makes me, but I can't stop. I used to be mean to him, back when it first started, but I can't anymore. I'm sure he doesn't deserve it. It all happens off camera now. Suddenly, you're available, and I rush in.

I don't think I'm rescuing you, because you're the type to rescue yourself. I just want to be with you. You're always suspicious of me. That's the writer taking over. I can't believe a fantasy where everything is easy. I must convince you. I must earn the right to be with you. It's not easy.

I ask my mother to ask your mother to set us up. It makes the most sense. Dinner with your parents. Your father thinks I'm a stalker. I'm not upset. That's his job. Your mother understands I care for you but not how much. She's usually on my side. You don't understand, and I don't blame you. It's weird. I won't deny it. But it's true. I just want to be with you.

You accuse me of lots of things, sometimes outright, sometimes by the way you look at me. I beg you to let me prove myself. I'll do anything for a chance. That's all I want. Just the chance to prove myself. But you still resist.

Sometimes I get desperate. I get angry or I start to cry. Not a great beginning. Sometimes I blurt out how I feel. Sometimes I explain it. Sometimes you believe me. Sometimes you don't.

Do a background search. That's what I tell you. Let your friends check me out. Talk to my family. Anything. Please. Give me a chance to prove myself. Please. You don't understand what you mean to me. You are everything to me. Please. Just one chance. That's all I ask. If you're right, your friends will notice. If I'm right, and you push me away, you'll lose someone who genuinely cares for you. Isn't that worth the risk?

Why?

You ask me that over and over. What can I say? Why can't you understand?

You are smart, funny, beautiful, caring, strong, and a fighter. You want to save the world one person at a time. You are special. You are wonderful. You are the best I've ever known.

WHY ISN'T THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU?!

Sometimes I say it. Sometimes I scream it. Sometimes you listen. Sometimes you don't.

How can I get through to you? What can I do? What is good enough for you? What do you want?

I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU!

For fuck's sake.

I'm in love with you.

That's all. That's everything. That's all I can give you.

I'm in love with you.

Why isn't that good enough? How can I be good enough? What do you want me to do? I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose my only chance with you.

I want to be with you. That's all. I want to be a part of your life. I want you to be a part of mine. I want you to tell me all the things that matter to you. I want to tell you all the things that matter to me. I want to show you where I'm strongest and where I'm weakest and where I hurt and where I really hurt. I want to support you. I want to hold you up. I want to make you happy. I want to make you smile, because, god, I love your smile. I want to hold on and never let go.

I'm in love with you.

This song is significant to me because of when you used to attend my church and watch me sing on stage. I sang this song a lot, I was sick of it! But it felt special that I finally had someone to sing to, that wasn't just my Dad and God. I had you, and you helped me find God with your words. Your letters, your funny affirmations, and safety ""features"" (safety first) when we hung out. When I spent more time with you, you matched the soul attached to me. It speaks to me every day, like all the time! 

I kept hearing your name today and I filmed it. The first time it happened,I was eating at a Thai restaurant. I didn't realize the sign until the food showed up. I got that on camera, too. Yay! More proof!

Well, anyways, it's not fun living my reality right now. God told me a man was dangerous at Gonzaga last Thursday. I was leaving work. He had a large knife, and I got my phone out and called attention to him being dangerous to students. God spoke through me, and no one else cared. I was the only one that stopped it. When I was filming, my ex called to check on me meeting up that day. It was happening during this time I was yelling at the man with the knife. The video stopped recording at 1:11... 1 min and 11 seconds! OMG! It happened again and that was my sign of confirmation! I'm so happy to be of help! Because, there have been murders in Idaho recently and I just want everyone safe. (Safety first!) So, I spoke my truth and followed God's guidance. 

There are so many songs I run across, and all speak to me with lyrics... it's very overwhelming trying to block out all the messages and work a normal job. I need your help, I want to pray with you and hear your testimony about your path with God, and how you are approaching everyday life situations with a spiritual perspective. Can you speak and receive messages from God, too? 

I think you can help ground me and teach me. People keep bringing up the story of Ed and Lorraine Warren around me... Am I supposed to look them up and connect their story to mine? Your name is the same as his. That's why people around me bring up that couple specifically. The other thing is how they met and knowing they were supposed to be together without knowing why at first. Then they became a power couple and their spiritual gifts together were heightened. They helped many others. I don't think we are going to be ghost slayers!! lol. I see your psychology background and faith will be very helpful with my abilities to connect to the other side and decipher the right way to explain it in a book so others can learn from the lesson. You said you wanted to be a college psychology professor and I see, you haven't met your goals just yet. I don't know what kind of medium I am yet. I'm not sure if it's clairvoyant, but Lorraine's story about how she suppressed her abilities as a child is similar to mine. I met Suz and she helped me understand the Bible and coincide it with the paranormal so I didn't feel like I was going to burn in hell for practicing spirituality outside of the church's philosophical approach. 

So, this Revelation Song, played just now after I watched a movie with Mike, it was called ""No Exit"". The All-State guy plays the character, Ed! I got my phone real quick to try and film it, but I did not want to look stupid in front of Mike. But yeah, I know you told me I'll never hear from you again. I'm expecting nothing back, but I'm really exposing myself at this point, and I don't want you to hate me for putting this out there and embarrassing you. I'm sorry. I'll delete everything when you message me, I promise. I just need to see if what I'm being told is real. They told me to post this song and speak my truth. It brings me only happy memories of singing to you about loving God.

Hey Boo. It’s midnight and I can’t sleep. I got scared a week ago about being super clingy to this whole idea of you being real…. I deleted everything I could that’s recent. I’m having contradicting thoughts because I’m getting lost in my head about the unknown. I’m losing focus and concentration about what’s important. It’s not healthy for me and I’m looking into talking to someone about it. I’m trying to find a way to bring it up where I don’t sound crazy. I’m more on the side of notion that I recently broke up with a long-term partner because he reminds me of my ex that I’d never let go of. Now I’m going through the break up and realized what I’ve done with the current partner. It’s not fair to either party and I’ve decided to break up and reflect on each one…. I think that will be more text book appropriate, so they don’t mess up my charts and consider me mentally unstable…. Ugh. This is gonna be one interesting therapy session. 

I’m not listening to tarot as much, but I am getting better at practicing it. I am getting accurate confirmations when I use multiple decks, the same cards fly out. It’s freaking creepy and super cool. I get so excited when I know I’m doing something random and it feels coincidental. That’s how I know it’s true. Suz told me to look for signs out of the norm or things that are repetitive. 

Well, I started work this week on Sunday. I miss working. One month to myself is too long. I like to stay distracted. I stopped fucking around thinking about you. I deleted my emails addressed to you. You know, just in-case I might accidently send it to someone. I still have drafts, but it’s not easy to just stumble on like earlier. I’m getting super paranoid for sure. I’m super anxious again. My heart is racing when a thought of you crosses my mind. Small mundane things are popping up that I have no control over and it’s you all over again…. Reminding me that you’re still around. What I mean by that is… I am able to shut you out of my head for a few days and hide anything that reminds me of you, but in my waking life….. You find ways to fucking show back up regardless of my efforts to ignore your ass! Don’t feel bad, I kinda picture you laughing at this part of my paragraph. Because it sounds so random and elaborate, but it’s you, being cocky and sneaky! You think I only have known you for 5 months, but over the years just talking to you in spirit, I see such a different version of you now than before. It feels more accurate oddly enough…. I don’t want to say that I’m right and seem arrogant myself, but I got to be at this point of the paragraph right?!

I’m starting to take pictures and short videos for you, to show you later of the things to attach on here while explaining the examples. I’m not very tech savvy, but I’ll do my best. What is keeping me from sleeping tonight is what happened yesterday morning. I pull up to park my car at work and as I’m turning off my podcast that fucking song plays!…. “Shut Up and Dance with Me” at 5:55 am…. I got my phone out and turned off my car so you can hear my car start up and the song show up on the radio. I’m in denial, cuz…. No, just no…. Then at 5:55am, when I was going to start walking to clock in at work…. The synchronicities and the meaning behind repeating numbers…. Every time I see a clock now, I see patterns. I get phone calls or people say dumb shit like you would and I’d check the time just to make sure…… I’m looking for every small detail, just to prove to myself, I’m not making this shit up. I’m almost making it a game now. I’ll look up to the sky if I’m outside and I’d be saying 

“Ok God, what type of shit you gonna throw at me today?!” 

In a nice/sarcastic way, I promise, it was with good intentions.

I got 2 recordings for you on the spot, don’t let me forget to at least play them off my phone for you if I can’t attach it here. Then I’d be driving, and I have a song playing that says a certain lyric about love and it stands out strongly yelling it’s words at me!  One day, I was driving with my coworker Chase, that whole day reminded me of you. I stopped my car and turned around to take a picture of a sign that had your name on it. The song playing at the time was “Wonderwall” the lyric playing at the exact time was at 11:55am, I read the sign… 

“I don’t believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now. 

The way I feel about you now.

And all the roads we had to walk are winding, 

And all the lights that lead us there are blinding, 

There are many things that I would like to say to you, 

but I don’t know how”

Then we had panda express and I got a fortune from my cookie telling me about a business endeavor and the panda of course on the damn cup… You and panda’s…. I kept all my panda stickers for some reason…. Now I see why.

People around me are saying “Shenanigans”, “Onwards and Upwards”, “It is what it is”, I’m meeting people named “Ed” or “Hunter”, I see a version of the car you drove when I knew you drive around more so than other cars. Being around Mike right now is not easy, because he does “Filipino” stuff, because that’s him, but in my mind, I see you. Then he doesn’t even look like himself anymore and I have to rub my eyes and walk away because I don’t want Mike to think I’m acting weird or let him see me cry because what he is doing is reminding me of you. I’m acting different than I usually am around him. I realized what I’ve been doing this whole time now and I see it. I woke up. I put a stop to it, and I told him everything. He is in more denial about it than I am. I’m more stoked about seeing you than I am upset for pretending. It wasn’t healthy by any means, but it makes sense even with all the negativity we went through. I denied what I was doing and staying, thinking he can be something he’s not….. I see what I’m doing and instead of being afraid of facing my truth, I’ve realized, I really fucking love you a lot! If I am still thinking of you for this long and I dated a man that was basically “you” in the best version of you I could think of creating…. I did a pretty good job at it for not trying. Mike came to me. I never went out of my way to find him when I moved to Seattle and when I moved to Spokane and ran into him by accident the second time. Both of you are very real and meant to be there to show me this. I hope this doesn’t turn you off to me as I’m openly sharing this information. It was kinda creepy how it all turned out, but then that’s confirmation that I never let our relationship go and I really do miss you. 

I cringe every time I hear something that sounds like you or reminds me of you in any fashion. I look up and I just role my eyes…. Thinking in my head 

“Are you freaking serious right now?!”

But I can’t talk about it with anyone and I have to keep my composure around people. Sometimes I get super giddy and excited and smile, cuz I know I’m going to see you soon. Then I get super sad, cuz I’m stuck only thinking about all of this and you’re not really in contact with me yet and I want you to be real… SO… Yeah, It keeps me up at night…. It’s really hard ignoring all the small signs as each day passes. I’ll try to keep track for you and even better each day, means it’s another day closer to you coming to terms about us and finally reaching out to me in reality.

I’ve always been here waiting for you, even when I wasn’t aware that I was doing it.

Can’t wait to give you that bear hug someday soon Boo…..

"I feel absolutely pathetic writing this…. But I’ve done everything. Everything to get over you, get over this. Now I’m playing into the largest cliche of writing down my feelings, since I’m unable to channel it through anything else.

I feel so stupid, everyday, I have to face a reflection of my own stupidity.

Hey Boo, 

 I was shown a few things when I had the urge to backtrack and see what the hell it is, I am doing here and for what.... What do you mean you ask?!... The way you feel so damn confused and your judgment is clouded. It scares me just as much as it scares you. You set it aside not understanding why you’re stuck and walk away. Thinking maybe that was the best solution to the problem. To let go of holding on and flow with the currents. I didn't get it either. 

 What came to mind is my favorite movie in place of the symbol behind the scenes that sticks to me like glue. My first one of all time is, What Dreams May Come. When Robin William’s character travels to hell to find his wife Anne. She commits suicide in reality because she lost her family to random deaths. Robin's character felt his wife so intuitively, that he knew no matter how deep into hell Anne placed herself in. He would find her telepathically through memories. Once he did, he played her game and decided to stay in hell with her. He was sacrificing his soul in order to release her back to heaven to live with their children. Love made her remember while he started to lose his memory and become part of hell. 

 This all came together for me while processing my past. I reflected on their love story and felt that I'd already experienced Anne's painful path of destruction. I had my ""Dark Night of the Soul"" moment. I've been on both sides of the fence now and have more clarity. I am that light trying to shine bright to find ""you"". To remind you what I am doing here. Why do I feel that connection to you so intensely and want you so much?! But you're too conflicted to understand your own desires? 

 So, I’d like to think I'm playing Robin’s character now and you're Anne. You're stuck in your prison, and I’m finally getting out of mine. I know who you are! I know how to speak to you, and this is why I've been writing these letters this whole time. Before I ever met you, I kept writing regardless of my circumstances. I always made you a part of my life. To remind you of who you are to me. What you’re worth. How to find your way back to God and to grow with me while you do it. Let my struggles teach you how to find your own path to self-love while understanding how I found mine. I never lived a day without you in my mind guiding me with your wisdom. I reached out telepathically to feel you near me. No matter if we were apart or together, I know your energy, when I finally found it, it made me want to resist you out of fear. I had to read my own letters to remind myself what I was doing subconsciously. I had to find myself all over again. I kept writing and moving forward. Doing so, showed me my patterns and each time I turned back to them, I received a different message hiding behind my words. I may not understand why I do things the way I do, but I listen to my heart and follow what it leads me towards accomplishing. I want to break the toxic cycle of my patterns for good. I feel like I'm ready to move forward into a new chapter in my life. 

 In my madness, I had this awareness hiding inside me the whole time. This is my test and for whatever reason, you need to pass yours. I can't make the decision for you. I'm already head underwater and all I have left is my hand sticking above the surface. I can't tell you any further, what this is about, I’m not supposed to. Now the choice is up to you. 

What do you want most in this life to accomplish?

Who do you want to walk that path with God together? 

What will make you happy?

 I've been through hell enough times. I know the cycle and I'm tired of it. I choose peace. I want to love. I am deserving of all forms of love with “you”. You just have to believe in it too. The veil will come off. I want to slowly tell you everything I know and share my past in order for you to grow along with me and rediscover yourself. I get it now. I want you to allow me to show you what it is I see. I see...“You”. Please look within and find what it is you're hiding away so deeply and let me in. God crossed our paths for a reason, please give me that chance to explain myself by allowing me your time and trust. Let me guide you to the light through my letters and bring you out of that sea of darkness. 

I love you Boo,

Tina,",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-01-23T07:37:51.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;12/8/22&lt;/p&gt;

"My ex and I broke up because she wanted to focus on herself and I want her back more than anything in the world. I want to write her a letter however I’m not the best writer. I wrote something but want it to be more romantic. I’ve tried my best but i want it to be as touching as possible. Can you guys give me feedback/corrections? :)

Dear ...,
I am hoping that we will find a way to reconnect again. I understand that you may need time for yourself, but I am writing this because I cannot imagine a life without you and the longer we spend time apart the more I crave you. If this is really worth fighting for let’s just sit down and try to find a solution, let’s find a reason to stay together.

You told me to give you space and my brain is telling me to not bother you, however my heart is asking me all these questions about you ‘’did you eat’’ ‘’did you sleep well’’ ‘’is she okay’’ ‘’does she miss me’’ ‘’what will you do today’’

 The reason I got so attached to you was because you were my first to many things, you were the reason I wished the days would go by faster just so I could see you faster. You were the first person I never wanted to stop talking to, you were my first person to almost everything. It all went fast and I do not regret any of it for a single second.

you said a couple times it is not my business anymore but it still is to me since I still have feelings for you. These feelings for you will not disappear as my heart belongs to you. I feel at home wherever I am with you. The day at the lakeside building we were dancing made me feel so close with you after a difficult time feeling your affection. Your smile, your excitement of seeing me makes me feel in love all over again all the time. Or the times you came to Weggis to see me, you even came in the morning which made me realize you are of a kind. 私はあなたを見つけたので、楽園は要りません。 私にはあなたがいるので、夢は要りません。

You want to spend more time on yourself to grow up and become independent and spend less time with me. I find this a very good decision as it’s also one of the reasons why you came to Switzerland. But it hurts knowing you talk to other guys, go clubbing and moved on so quickly. Maybe there is someone else already in line who gives you butterflies, but what does it equate. He may make you feel beautiful but will he stay on your side when things get tough or will he just vanish. I want to stay on your side for as long as our lives last. I want to give you butterflies again every day. I know it because we have been through hard times but always made it out stronger. I want to cherish you every day and it was difficult these moments wanting to see each other but we couldn’t. I want to devote my free time I have into you as I can spend the time I need for myself while waiting for you.

Your growing process is of course important but why can’t it happen while being on your side? Maybe things will be different than but every decision shapes you into another person. I want to have your back make you feel safe and most importantly be there in the good times and in the worst times. I know you have been through shit and I want to be the person who you can trust and look forward to at all times. You said you don’t have feelings for me anymore, however I know they are still there as it just doesn’t disappear. Love doesn’t rust even if you say so, love doesn’t rust away.
You are already independent and can achieve much by yourself, yes sometimes you need my help or I help you but I don’t do it because I think you can’t but I do these things out of love. Real love. As a person grows older we become more independent, it will come naturally and I can give you more responsibility to become more independent. You can even while being on internship hang out with people, make new friends as you are a social person. You shouldn’t be sitting inside your room the whole day waiting for my texts like a bird in a cage. I encourage you to jump in the deep and gain experience or make new friends. I did the same while being with you and wanting to see you every day.
I remember the time I was laying with my head on you and you kissed me on my head and said ‘’you don’t know how much I love you’’. Thinking back this makes my heart melt and give me butterflies all the time.
The world is yours and I want to conquer the world together with you.

Do you really want to reconnect in one year or three years? Let your view get shaped by others who might mistreat you or hurt you. I fear and I am certain that it will only be harder to feel closer to each other.

Maybe the reason what also lead to our break up was because your surrounding people were all single, but at the end of the day they all look for someone to not be alone, even if it’s just a simple hook up. You deserve better than to be treated than just a hook up and I know I have treated you cold but I know better now and I will not let you feel cold again by me. I care about you and I did make mistakes I admit. 

We are both unique persons where we will not be a second version of and we have our own difficulties, problems, insecurities but we were there for each other. You made me quit my addiction which I am thankful for as it opened my eyes to what really matters in life and that is the present. I want to be alive in the present and being in the present with you is the greatest gift life has ever given me

I want to go to the next stage together. Improving myself while being together. I want to be in good physique and you’re a huge motivation for me to improve myself 

You are precious to me and I have always visualized the long term with you. We can find a solution as I am willing to fight for you, for our relationship. You said you lost your feelings for me but it’s still there on the inside. 

Let’s comeback to each other and I promise you to succeed in the next stage of our growing process
 

I let these words come from my soul and hope it touches yours. Just like the way my soul touches yours when I sleep on your chest. I was fine sleeping in a one person bed as long as you were there with me. You are the greatest gift given to me and I don’t want our love to be over, I want you back more than anything in this world

When we are together the sun shines brighter, the food tastes better, the world becomes prettier and life feels better. 

Please read this letter carefully and let your decision be decided and not the decision of others. You are my paradise and as time tells it will be my paradise",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-01-10T06:19:15.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My ex and I broke up because she wanted to focus on herself and I want her back more than anything in the world. I want to write her a letter however I’m not the best writer. I wrote something but want it to be more romantic. I’ve tried my best but i want it to be as touching as possible. Can you guys give me feedback/corrections? :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear ...,
I am hoping that we will find a way to reconnect again. I understand that you may need time for yourself, but I am writing this because I cannot imagine a life without you and the longer we spend time apart the more I crave you. If this is really worth fighting for let’s just sit down and try to find a solution, let’s find a reason to stay together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You told me to give you space and my brain is telling me to not bother you, however my heart is asking me all these questions about you ‘’did you eat’’ ‘’did you sleep well’’ ‘’is she okay’’ ‘’does she miss me’’ ‘’what will you do today’’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The reason I got so attached to you was because you were my first to many things, you were the reason I wished the days would go by faster just so I could see you faster. You were the first person I never wanted to stop talking to, you were my first person to almost everything. It all went fast and I do not regret any of it for a single second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you said a couple times it is not my business anymore but it still is to me since I still have feelings for you. These feelings for you will not disappear as my heart belongs to you. I feel at home wherever I am with you. The day at the lakeside building we were dancing made me feel so close with you after a difficult time feeling your affection. Your smile, your excitement of seeing me makes me feel in love all over again all the time. Or the times you came to Weggis to see me, you even came in the morning which made me realize you are of a kind. 私はあなたを見つけたので、楽園は要りません。 私にはあなたがいるので、夢は要りません。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want to spend more time on yourself to grow up and become independent and spend less time with me. I find this a very good decision as it’s also one of the reasons why you came to Switzerland. But it hurts knowing you talk to other guys, go clubbing and moved on so quickly. Maybe there is someone else already in line who gives you butterflies, but what does it equate. He may make you feel beautiful but will he stay on your side when things get tough or will he just vanish. I want to stay on your side for as long as our lives last. I want to give you butterflies again every day. I know it because we have been through hard times but always made it out stronger. I want to cherish you every day and it was difficult these moments wanting to see each other but we couldn’t. I want to devote my free time I have into you as I can spend the time I need for myself while waiting for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your growing process is of course important but why can’t it happen while being on your side? Maybe things will be different than but every decision shapes you into another person. I want to have your back make you feel safe and most importantly be there in the good times and in the worst times. I know you have been through shit and I want to be the person who you can trust and look forward to at all times. You said you don’t have feelings for me anymore, however I know they are still there as it just doesn’t disappear. Love doesn’t rust even if you say so, love doesn’t rust away.
You are already independent and can achieve much by yourself, yes sometimes you need my help or I help you but I don’t do it because I think you can’t but I do these things out of love. Real love. As a person grows older we become more independent, it will come naturally and I can give you more responsibility to become more independent. You can even while being on internship hang out with people, make new friends as you are a social person. You shouldn’t be sitting inside your room the whole day waiting for my texts like a bird in a cage. I encourage you to jump in the deep and gain experience or make new friends. I did the same while being with you and wanting to see you every day.
I remember the time I was laying with my head on you and you kissed me on my head and said ‘’you don’t know how much I love you’’. Thinking back this makes my heart melt and give me butterflies all the time.
The world is yours and I want to conquer the world together with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you really want to reconnect in one year or three years? Let your view get shaped by others who might mistreat you or hurt you. I fear and I am certain that it will only be harder to feel closer to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the reason what also lead to our break up was because your surrounding people were all single, but at the end of the day they all look for someone to not be alone, even if it’s just a simple hook up. You deserve better than to be treated than just a hook up and I know I have treated you cold but I know better now and I will not let you feel cold again by me. I care about you and I did make mistakes I admit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are both unique persons where we will not be a second version of and we have our own difficulties, problems, insecurities but we were there for each other. You made me quit my addiction which I am thankful for as it opened my eyes to what really matters in life and that is the present. I want to be alive in the present and being in the present with you is the greatest gift life has ever given me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to go to the next stage together. Improving myself while being together. I want to be in good physique and you’re a huge motivation for me to improve myself &lt;/p&gt;

"You had no idea what you did. Neither did I. We flirted and smiled at each other. We were teenagers. That's what we were supposed to do. I kept that memory, because Asperger's can lock them in pretty tight, and I used it. I pulled it up just to feel good, like a favorite song. You were someone I had a crush on once and a memory that helped me when I felt low. Simple. Really. Self-soothing autobiographical memory. That's all it was until it was more. Until the dopamine and oxytocin built up in my system. They reinforced the memories of you from that day and from grade school. They did their jobs as intended. Trained emotional responses to reinforced memory pathways. It happens all the time. With neurotypicals, anyway. Not so much with me. Not ever with me, actually. Not until you. Not until I did this to myself.

I fell in love with you.

I understand the mechanism. Mostly. I'm still researching it. I understand all ""connection"" is internal. Independently developed corresponding responses resulting from shared experiences. We had none. As I said, I did this to myself. It is why we have the words ""reciprocate"" and ""unrequited"". I knew that from the beginning.

I'm probably not nothing to you. You might still have some fond memories of me. But I am not the same to you that you are to me. I know that. I am not delusional, and I am not irrational.

I am in love with you.

That's all. As if that were nothing. To neurotypicals, maybe it is. To us, it is the impossible dream. You can't really understand that. Asperger's is like being born in solitary confinement. My everyday would break most people. It has nearly broken me more than once.

Forty years. That's what it took. A trickle, not a flood. I had no idea until the depression hit. Even then, I wouldn't believe it. Not until I had science to back it up. Or theory, anyway. Some of it is speculation, but it's reasonable. And, I know how I feel. Or, I think I do. I don't have a point of comparison. It feels the way I always thought it should feel. That's why I say it the way I do.

I am in love with you.

Probably. And it hurts. More than anything ever. I can't be with you. I know that. I also can't be with anyone else. If I look at another woman, I feel like I'm cheating. Isn't that stupid?

I know none of this makes sense, but nothing in my life ever does. That is the hand I drew. You got the normal cards. I got the cards people try to toss away. I'm sure, if you do see this, you will never believe it. No one would. Not even me.

I will always be in love with you.

Even through the pain. Pain is better than emptiness. Believe me. All this drama, and for what? For an emotion the world decided I wasn't allowed to feel. I can't love my family. I feel guilty if I try to say it to them. That was my reality until you found a way around it. And you never knew. You will never know.

And I will never love anyone else.

Not ever.

Don't doubt that.

Please.

Show me that much respect. I didn't come to this answer easily. Whatever doubts you might have, know this:

I *am* in love with you.

Always.",,"r/LoveLetters","2023-01-11T00:27:46.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;You had no idea what you did. Neither did I. We flirted and smiled at each other. We were teenagers. That&amp;#39;s what we were supposed to do. I kept that memory, because Asperger&amp;#39;s can lock them in pretty tight, and I used it. I pulled it up just to feel good, like a favorite song. You were someone I had a crush on once and a memory that helped me when I felt low. Simple. Really. Self-soothing autobiographical memory. That&amp;#39;s all it was until it was more. Until the dopamine and oxytocin built up in my system. They reinforced the memories of you from that day and from grade school. They did their jobs as intended. Trained emotional responses to reinforced memory pathways. It happens all the time. With neurotypicals, anyway. Not so much with me. Not ever with me, actually. Not until you. Not until I did this to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the mechanism. Mostly. I&amp;#39;m still researching it. I understand all &amp;quot;connection&amp;quot; is internal. Independently developed corresponding responses resulting from shared experiences. We had none. As I said, I did this to myself. It is why we have the words &amp;quot;reciprocate&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;unrequited&amp;quot;. I knew that from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m probably not nothing to you. You might still have some fond memories of me. But I am not the same to you that you are to me. I know that. I am not delusional, and I am not irrational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all. As if that were nothing. To neurotypicals, maybe it is. To us, it is the impossible dream. You can&amp;#39;t really understand that. Asperger&amp;#39;s is like being born in solitary confinement. My everyday would break most people. It has nearly broken me more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forty years. That&amp;#39;s what it took. A trickle, not a flood. I had no idea until the depression hit. Even then, I wouldn&amp;#39;t believe it. Not until I had science to back it up. Or theory, anyway. Some of it is speculation, but it&amp;#39;s reasonable. And, I know how I feel. Or, I think I do. I don&amp;#39;t have a point of comparison. It feels the way I always thought it should feel. That&amp;#39;s why I say it the way I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably. And it hurts. More than anything ever. I can&amp;#39;t be with you. I know that. I also can&amp;#39;t be with anyone else. If I look at another woman, I feel like I&amp;#39;m cheating. Isn&amp;#39;t that stupid?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know none of this makes sense, but nothing in my life ever does. That is the hand I drew. You got the normal cards. I got the cards people try to toss away. I&amp;#39;m sure, if you do see this, you will never believe it. No one would. Not even me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will always be in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even through the pain. Pain is better than emptiness. Believe me. All this drama, and for what? For an emotion the world decided I wasn&amp;#39;t allowed to feel. I can&amp;#39;t love my family. I feel guilty if I try to say it to them. That was my reality until you found a way around it. And you never knew. You will never know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I will never love anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t doubt that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show me that much respect. I didn&amp;#39;t come to this answer easily. Whatever doubts you might have, know this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; in love with you.&lt;/p&gt;

"&gt;I can't be with you. I know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Why not?*

She's married.

&gt;I also can't be with anyone else.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Why not?*

She is the only person in my life I have ever been able to love.  I didn't believe I could feel this way until her.

&gt;If I look at another woman, I feel like I'm cheating. Isn't that stupid?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Yes.*

That's still how I feel.

&gt;I will always be in love with you.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Why do you think that? Autistic black-and-white thinking?*

Because this is the only time I've ever felt this way, and I will hold on to it no matter what.

&gt;And I will never love anyone else.  
&gt;  
&gt;Not ever.  
&gt;  
&gt;Don't doubt that.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Why though? What do you even love about this person? It seems like you're experiencing limerence, not love.*

Because it took 40 years to do this to myself.  I needed exactly the right set of conditions, and I can't recreate them.  Bypassing Asperger's isn't easy.  I didn't know I had done it until the depression hit.  And, limerence is just a pretentious word for crush.  I know what that feels like.  This is different.

I'm not offended by your questions, but I thought this through.  Situational depression is amazing for focus.  Better than Adderall.  Your questions point to moving on.  That's a nice idea, but how do I move on from the only human being on the planet I have ever loved or ever could love?  This isn't romance.  It's neurology.  I didn't cure my Asperger's.  I found a loophole that I didn't know existed, and I could only use it once.  I don't *want* this answer, but I must *accept* this answer.

We never “talked” but she was the prototype for every female I had ever held feelings for. After that dream she was literally the girl of my dreams, but only a few years after meeting her she seemingly erased herself from my mind.

Until we ran into each other 5 years ago. She said “Father Time?” In a demeaning, pandering way. Obviously joking about how long it’s been but also my disheveled appearance.

I never said anything, just walked with her a short time and departed our separate ways. 

Why not say anything?

Honestly, I still love you. Nothing can change that, the only thing I could do is,hopefully it works, that I would be out of your life and you not having to be around will be the best thing I could do to myself. 
It doesn't work for me na kasi. I understand that I am not what you wanted, I was just there when you needed me but you are not around when I needed you. Gestures, I could read those. Not wanting physical contact with you hurts me more than you think. But you would use that against me, try to initiate physical contact. My mind says no, hearts say yes, my body language doesn't react. Thank the universe for that. 
I am really hoping that you would not be in my life. 

I hope you don't change your mind. As you said ""Hanggang friends lang"", you didn't even think of me as a friend tapos ganyan? HAHAHA. Trying to cut ties and trying to distract myself. I'm sorry that I'm trying my best to distance myself, why would I not reciprocate what you are trying to do? Iyon naman gusto mo, I'll return the favor.

Always remember, I'll always be here for you if you need help. Hindi magbabago ang sinabi kong I'll be there if you need my help, hindi magbabago ang sinabi kong tutulungan kita. Hopefully masaya ka para hindi mo ako maisip, always naman ganun. Pag masaya kana hindi mo ako naiisip.

Please don't impede my progress towards my self actualization. Okay naman ako noong wala ka sa buhay ko. I know my worth if you can't see it today, please sana hindi mo parin makita after nating mag separate ways. Made my mind about it. Take care of yourself. You don't want me to eh.

"To anyone who may be out there or one who controls fate,

There are many people out there who experience love the way I always wanted to. Bumping into someone and seeing stars all around you. Suddenly, the world is vibrant, you take good care of your body and feel great. The people around you can see how happy you are. For the longest time, I never experienced that kind of love. Well. I did. Just in short bursts. From an early age, love was taught to me by my parents. That it was okay to argue and yell at each other. Then I learned about love through romance comedy’s like ‘27 Dresses’. I was hooked on that kind of love. I was a “love of first sight” kind of girl.

At a young age I met a guy who was older than me. I thought I was in love. I made the first mistake by falling in love. It wasn’t the love I wanted.

I dated a stranger online. He ghosted me several weeks later. I still remember the last video he sent me on my shitty phone of him skateboarding to his class. It wasn’t the love I wanted.

As I got older I dated a few people. One guy in middle school. It only lasted a couple days because I wasn’t as popular as him. It wasn’t the love I wanted.

In high school I dated someone and I wasn’t the nicest person to him. I wasn’t even sure if I was in love. I just convinced myself I was. It wasn’t the love I wanted.

I met a guy online. He was the sweetest man anyone could ask for. He was handsome and he supported me. I wasn’t even close to being as attractive as him. I remember his group chat shared a pic of me and the friends said “Oh.” I felt so embarrassed. The last night we talked, we promised to watch a movie together. I didn’t show up. I deleted everything. I was so scared. It wasn’t the love I wanted.

I tried dating apps. However, the people I met either lived with their ex or had me pay for the whole date. It wasn’t the love I wanted

My brother married within a 2 year relationship. My sister found her high school sweetheart again and has been with him since. The universe is so cruel to me.

I might go to the nearest museum everyday from now on and hope I might bump into someone there. I maybe older and wiser but the little girl within my soul still wants that ”showstopper, hearthrobbing, stars in my eyes” moment.

In a book I read awhile ago, I can’t remember the book, but I remember relating to the character cause he thought every person has a soulmate. Not one where if the soulmate leaves then those two would never find another love. But that a soulmate can come and go.

Maybe my soulmate isn’t anyone. Maybe it is. I don’t know. I feel dramatic writing this letter but I want the universe to know that I wish to experience my fairytale love-at-first-sight.

&lt;p&gt;I met a guy online. He was the sweetest man anyone could ask for. He was handsome and he supported me. I wasn’t even close to being as attractive as him. I remember his group chat shared a pic of me and the friends said “Oh.” I felt so embarrassed. The last night we talked, we promised to watch a movie together. I didn’t show up. I deleted everything. I was so scared. It wasn’t the love I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried dating apps. However, the people I met either lived with their ex or had me pay for the whole date. It wasn’t the love I wanted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother married within a 2 year relationship. My sister found her high school sweetheart again and has been with him since. The universe is so cruel to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might go to the nearest museum everyday from now on and hope I might bump into someone there. I maybe older and wiser but the little girl within my soul still wants that ”showstopper, hearthrobbing, stars in my eyes” moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a book I read awhile ago, I can’t remember the book, but I remember relating to the character cause he thought every person has a soulmate. Not one where if the soulmate leaves then those two would never find another love. But that a soulmate can come and go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe my soulmate isn’t anyone. Maybe it is. I don’t know. I feel dramatic writing this letter but I want the universe to know that I wish to experience my fairytale love-at-first-sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Universe, all I want in my life is to watch the stars with someone for the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

"I’m awake at dawn and wondering how I got so lucky to be next to you. It’s been four years, and yet, multiple times a week I’ll look at you with hearts in my eyes and satisfaction rumbling deep in my belly. I don’t think this feeling will ever go away. 

You once told me “at this point in a relationship I’ve historically picked fights or tapered off, desperate for new experiences without them…but I want to see you everyday. I want my new experiences with you.” And I replied telling you about how by now I’d have been taking my partner for granted, bored of them and feeling stuck but loved “just well enough”. 

I think that tells us we both met our match. We met our Sunday mornings and our Friday nights. We met our favourite meals, the one that can be made over and over again but never gets old. 

I met my husband. 

I mean, not yet of course. You’re not even my fiancé but you said you would be by the end of the year. So matter of fact. And I just agreed, as if it were fact as well. 

That’s what I love about us. We’re easy. We’re easy and yet you still bend me over with the same passion in your eyes as when we weee first dating. 

I’m lucky. 

Sometimes I want to spend hours and hours telling my friends and family the way you make me feel. I don’t, because I think at 26 it almost feels like bragging. 

I can’t help but want to brag about you.

I wish I could explain the joy of knowing you found your person. I never saw a healthy relationship growing up- but I do think we’re going to be that. Our kids are going to see mom and dad kiss and dance and laugh and play. I can’t explain how important that is. How lucky our family will be to have you too.

"I am definitely a ""late bloomer"" in life.  In school, I was overweight and awkward (this never went away).  Whilst everybody was maturing and learning how to talk to girls, I just kept going further into my shell.  It felt safe and I never felt I was deserving of love or affection beyond what you get from your family.  University came and I never got around to getting rid of that awkward side of me.  I was the same person except, now, I drank a lot more and spent more time outside.  This had no influence on being able to meet people and have any sort of meaningful relationships.

I found my sport and trained very hard.  I lost the weight.  I dressed better.  I had more confidence.  I put serious time into self help books and podcasts into learning what to say and do to girls to not be weird but also express interest.  Of course, over time, there was a word for this - flirting.

It was then everything changed.

I was doing my Masters in a city I had always been around but never really seen.  It was then me and my best friend started to regularly go to an indie music club.  The playlist never changed, the floors were sticky, and the drinks were cheap.  If you've ever been a student in the UK, you know this club.  The memory which resonated the most with me was an evening where we were out, like most weekends.  A girl a lot shorter than me was wearing a sombrero and for a laugh, I just stole it from her with every intention of giving it back.  After wearing it for about ten seconds, I put it back on her head and she just kept looking at me.

I had never seen this look before.  It's the kind where you see an old friend you've missed, or something you never knew you wanted but, now you've seen it, you must have it.  It's the kind of look your body automatically recognises and takes over the controls which it does.  Autopilot locks eyes.  We gravitated towards each other.  My heart is going crazy but I don't know what's going on, yet, it all feels so natural as if my brain on a diet of cheap vodka and redbull simply says, ""it's all good - I got this.  Just follow my lead and don't throw up"".  The music goes quiet, and it happens.  

I'm kissing a stranger.  A complete, beautiful stranger.  A lot of people will always have a really cute story in their mind of they really liked a person and would feel flutters for weeks, following on an endearing story about two young humans learning to express how they feel towards somebody in a very particular way.  For me, it was that except with a lot less words in the space of about 20 seconds.  

At the age of 24, she was the story of my first real kiss.  I will never know her name, but what I do know is that this person changed my life.  

The addiction of kissing strangers became a bit of a habit.  Actually, not even a bit.  A straight up habit.  I loved the rush and the fleeting moment.  In hindsight, it's a completely unique kind of romance. One which you can fully enjoy and remember as perfect without the danger of reality tarnishing that memory.  Although short-lived, it's no less intense or significant than meeting the partner you're going to spend the rest of your life with.  And it's those wonderful, gorgeous, and amazing girls I write a love letter to.

Jess.  We kissed to Dancing in the Moonlight by Toploader and then Don't Look Back in Anger by Oasis.  You wore braces and I was very careful.  After kissing for a solid 10 minutes, we shared names and you shook my hand with the cutest laugh - I loved that.  I love remembering your sense of humour.  The levity of your personality.  To this day, I still listen to these two songs in a row to relive that moment we had.  I am sorry I never asked for your number that night because I should have.  I didn't to not ruin the moment and taint it with the eventual disappointment had we carried on talking.  I hope you can forgive me and you are happy somewhere with somebody you deserve, all the while hoping you relive this memory with mutual fondness.

Elena.  I remember flirting with you as you were trying to find the queue for the cloakroom and we talked whilst collecting our coats.  It was near Christmas time and I remember using that as an excuse to steal a kiss.  You requested I add you on Facebook and, if I was being honest, I was far too old for you and always will be.  I hope you are doing amazing.

Girl wearing a white kind of dress.  Now, this was particularly cheeky from you.  You just came out of nowhere and started kissing my face and then just randomly disappeared only to find me again at the end of the night, I pointed at you, and you just kissed me again.  You kissed me like we had been together for ten years and we had fallen in love all over again.  Then that black guy who kept following you was a bit weird.  I hope you're doing well too.

Helen.  My beautiful barmaid.  The angel of the cloakroom.  I still think of the day you came to where I worked and I didn't realise it was you until it was too late.  You looked great, by the way.  Business dress suits you just as much as jean shorts and leggings.  I came out to look for you, y'know.  I ran out into the train station the second I could because I wanted us to have our chance, alas, it was far too late.  In all fairness, it had been many months since I gave you my number and you never called.    Whilst I'll always wonder what it'd have been like if we went on our date (I'll never forget you saying, ""I'd be happy with a Chinese buffet"" as a line), I hope you're with somebody half as great as you are and if we ever bump into each other again and the situation's right, I'd love to know how you're doing.

The girl in the sombrero.  Thank you.  Because without you, there'd be nobody else.

The place where it all happened.  When they announced you were closing, it was like a relative passing away.  It felt painful, but ultimately the right decision.  I have loved you from the start and I always will.

Lastly, to Eddy.  The best man I'll never have.  One of the only people who ever really treated me like a friend and actually cared about me.  I know you were going through a lot of bad shit just before you took your own life.  I should have been here in England with you.  Supporting you.  Actually being a friend instead of judging you and measuring myself against you.  I was too busy being selfish and blind to see that you were crying out for help.  I still see you in my dreams and those are the best dreams.  I miss you, man.  I miss you more than you'll ever know.  It is far too late for me to apologise now, but I am truly sorry.  I wish I could have been a better friend and stop this whole mess from happening.

"You don’t love me anymore. That much is certain, no matter how much you avoid saying it. I know.

But I miss you even when you’re right next to me. I miss you even when I don’t know what we are anymore. We’ve been together through our teen and early adult years, and now I’m almost 30 and wondering what I’m supposed to do to fill the time you were always present for me.

It’s been a long time since you kissed me, held me, even felt me. You enjoy my presence but not really me, not to my core, not who I am physically or otherwise. I don’t know where the shift happened, but I’ve made myself understand it.

Yet, I’ve sacrificed everything. My entire life revolves around you now. I’ve destroyed my finances to take care of things when you couldn’t. I’ve let go of my own dignity despite your lies, your anger, your cheating.

So, why do I still love you? I wish I knew myself. All I know now is that my heart goes cold when you’re not around. I don’t want to spend time with anyone but you.

SHE WAS THE BOMB!

I love her now; she is gone she was a tom. By midnight looking back to young love my first Kim the dark eyed girl, she was a Hearst.

Right from the start, she took my heart! Without your grin I fell apart!

It was broad daylight, then showed me her thighs I wanted to dive.

The rest of my rhyme:

Kim, I wanted your life! She didn't love me... instead the only femme my poor brain stem

When I found out I drove into the guardrail.

I Felt like junk mail, was blackmailed.

Kimie...still to the end you stole my heart ripped it apart!

You felt as cold as Stalingrad betrayed, sad, lover turned traitor my comrade in my arms.

I've lost you when a return to sender arrived from post mail. I wish you had your email.

"I don’t know how I’d express this in any other way than to simply type down my feelings in the most direct and occasionally ostentatious manner in which it passes my mind. But my mind hasn’t quite stopped thinking about you ever since you admitted to me how you felt and ever since you unintentionally forced me to acknowledge and come into terms with my own feelings for you. But I know how twisted my mind can get when it comes to these sorts of things and to be frank, at the time I’m writing this, I’m still unsure as to whether or not what I feel for you is genuine love or if it’s platonic affection laced with an extraordinary dose of adrenaline and hyperfixation that so often accompanies my tendency to latch on to someone that I feel - or believe - might sincerely love me too. Or if love is too strong a word or sweeping of a statement, then great affection might be a decent substitute for what I mean to say. I say this because I think, for a long time in a long time or perhaps for the first time ever for as long as I can recall, that you give me a sense of comfort and familiarity to an extent that I have not quite felt with most other people. Call me corny or even impressionable but I think we both share a degree of maturity, frankness, and self-awareness that isn’t very common in the people we surround ourselves with. I don’t know if this speaks to the degree of affection I feel for you or if it’s simply a show of mental progress on my part, but I think you might share similar feelings for me too. The sense that I’m not someone you commonly come across in your life. And that’s not to say I’m one of the most important figures in your life, not even close to it. But what I mean is that there are parts of you that you feel most comfortable conveying to me, the same way I to you. I don’t know if this feeling is temporary or if it’s staying for good until circumstances forces it to unravel and disintegrate down to moments of self-introspection and realisations about what I might have overlooked and exaggerated in this head of mine, but what I know is that I don’t know if I want this feeling to wither away. Despite the unfortunate and unreciprocated nature of my exact feelings, given the fact that you are taken and share your affections to another person who with no doubt, has played a more significant role in your life and your person, I almost wish this feeling would stay for as long as our circumstances would permit it. The feeling of your skin on mine undoubtedly makes me horny. I have no qualms about admitting that I wish we could have sex and fulfil this biological and emotional desire to become closer to one another. But more than that, the feeling of your touch makes me wish that it would just stay there yet somehow become more intense without you having to hold me tighter. It almost feels like I wish the part of your body touching me would become less concrete and eventually become more attached to mine to the point where I could no longer distinguish where my body ends and yours start. It would mould into one whole being. More than the desire for you to pleasure me the way I have to you is the desire to be guaranteed that your hugs and touches would continue for as long as we both keep desiring one another.

But my mind hasn’t quite stopped thinking about you ever since you admitted to me how you felt and ever since you unintentionally forced me to acknowledge and come into terms with my own feelings for you. But I know how twisted my mind can get when it comes to these sorts of things and to be frank, at the time I’m writing this, I’m still unsure as to whether or not what I feel for you is genuine love or if it’s platonic affection laced with an extraordinary dose of adrenaline and hyperfixation that so often accompanies my tendency to latch on to someone that I feel - or believe - might sincerely love me too. Or if love is too strong a word or sweeping of a statement, then great affection might be a decent substitute for what I mean to say. I say this because I think, for a long time in a long time or perhaps for the first time ever for as long as I can recall, that you give me a sense of comfort and familiarity to an extent that I have not quite felt with most other people. Call me corny or even impressionable but I think we both share a degree of maturity, frankness, and self-awareness that isn’t very common in the people we surround ourselves with. I don’t know if this speaks to the degree of affection I feel for you or if it’s simply a show of mental progress on my part, but I think you might share similar feelings for me too. The sense that I’m not someone you commonly come across in your life. And that’s not to say I’m one of the most important figures in your life, not even close to it. But what I mean is that there are parts of you that you feel most comfortable conveying to me, the same way I to you. I don’t know if this feeling is temporary or if it’s staying for good until circumstances forces it to unravel and disintegrate down to moments of self-introspection and realisations about what I might have overlooked and exaggerated in this head of mine, but what I know is that I don’t know if I want this feeling to wither away. Despite the unfortunate and unreciprocated nature of my exact feelings, given the fact that you are taken and share your affections to another person who with no doubt, has played a more significant role in your life and your person, I almost wish this feeling would stay for as long as our circumstances would permit it. The feeling of your skin on mine undoubtedly makes me horny. I have no qualms about admitting that I wish we could have sex and fulfil this biological and emotional desire to become closer to one another. But more than that, the feeling of your touch makes me wish that it would just stay there yet somehow become more intense without you having to hold me tighter. It almost feels like I wish the part of your body touching me would become less concrete and eventually become more attached to mine to the point where I could no longer distinguish where my body ends and yours start. It would mould into one whole being. More than the desire for you to pleasure me the way I have to you is the desire to be guaranteed that your hugs and touches would continue for as long as we both keep desiring one another. I wish I could express to you all this in person but I know it’s not normal for someone to be this outright with what they’re feeling, Besides, the sincerity of my true feelings will always be obscured or unfairly exaggerated by the degree of linguistic lucidity and embellishment in which I pour my feelings into text. I admit it can be a bad habit of mine to make things sound prettier than it might be. So don’t take what I say here at word for word value, but be assured of my unwavering belief that I do feel a great deal of affection for you and that, for now at least, I crave your presence and touch for many hours of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

"I am 20M and my gf is 19F. We are both in college and we are both virgins. We met each other by our mutual friend like 8 months ago. It is a long distance relationship. We are both from India. Most of you know that people see you differently if a boy and a girl are even walking together and it is very true.

At our third meeting we were not given a same room because we are not married. It was very strict that ! can't even go to her room and talk. It made us very sad. We searched some other hotels that night and decided to change this hotel. Next morning we changed the hotel and that hotel didn't restricted anything. We both were very happy. After we got ready for the trip and went there.

In the trip we both enjoyed the every moment. We were so happy that we met each other after 3 months. After that we came back to hotel and we freshed up. She told that I am not allowed to see her when she is changing. I was a little sad after hearing that but it's ok. After some time we both layed on the bed and watched some reels together and laughed at some memes. We just had our 1st kiss there and it was amazing. Then I slowly touched her boobs and she liked. that. Then told her that can I touch your boobs properly means not on the t shirt but inside the bra. She said ok and started squeezing those nicely round shaped perfect boobs and she moaned and started to move around in the bed and held me tight. She is a little bit insecure about her boobs that they are big. I told her that they are perfect for her physique and they are very beautiful. Then we both got naked and i sucked her boobs and she squeezed my back while feeling the pleasure. I was so happy that she is feeling good. After like 3 hrs later we had our dinner and returned back to our hotel room and we just talked for sometime and I lifted her and put her on the bed and layed on top of her and kissed very passionately. We both got naked again and started sucking her boobs and gently touched her clit and she held my dick. I had almost came that time and told her to give a hand job and she accepted that and then we went to the bathroom and she started to give handjob and i squeezed her boobs simultaneously and after that I came and it was the best cumming experience in my life. But we promised that we won't have sex until we get married. Then we just slept peacefully like 3 hrs but again I started to pleasure her till the morning and she was very sad because she was leaving that morning. Her eyes were in tears and i was also very sad. I comforted her and and we had our breakfast and we went to the bus stand and waited for her bus and talked there in the bus stand. Bus came and she went inside the bus almost crying. I said that we will meet soon then we both went to our places.

Writing a letter to you because I miss you. Not sure if you can call it a love letter because the feelings I have are complicated- although I guess love is complicated, even though some people say it’s simple… In this moment I’m team complicated. Then that settles it: this is a love letter. I don’t know how to put everything into words but I’ll try. It feels like I’m not completely whole anymore now that I have no way of reaching you; there’s an aching absence that I can’t ignore, like a part of me has gone missing (only temporarily though; I keep reminding myself that you’ll be back soon). But I don’t know if I mean the same to you. In a way, I hope I don’t. 

You being my last thoughts as I fall asleep should be sweet but sometimes it’s tiring. I thought thinking about your lover as you lay in bed at night would leave me smiling in my sleep, but most nights I can only feel my tears on your shirt that I drape over my pillow. I pretend that I’m laying on your chest and I imagine your breath and your heartbeat. If it’s sad then you can just laugh at me. I think now you can understand why I hope you don’t love me the way I love you. I don’t want to occupy your thoughts so much, like how you occupy mine. There’s nothing I want more than for you to focus on yourself during this time apart from one another, to grow and achieve the goals that I know you’re working so hard towards. I really want you to achieve all your dreams and even just supporting you, watching you be the amazing person that you are is such a wonderful feeling. 

But to be perfectly honest, I’m selfish. I want to be in the thoughts that keep you up at night. I want you to miss me so much that you have at least a shadow of regret for leaving me so often. I want you to think of me even more because I get the feeling that I sit in one of the seats that are further back in your mind. I want you to cry the way that I do when you only have your thoughts for company at night. I want you to want me as much as I want you. The first time you told me you miss me on video call I almost cried, because you rarely tell me you miss me. Really, these feelings make me so guilty and conflicted. I’m almost starting to hate myself.

What if our friendship never had to be tested, and we could have continued on as if nothing ever

changed? What if life had offered us a different set of circumstances in which to forge a connection?

What if we didn't suddenly drift away?

Despite all of the might-have-beens, I am truly grateful for the love we experienced together.

 

And maybe I'll never truly be over you. No matter how many times I say I am, no matter how many

And when I think back on our weird relationship, I realize how much we had, even with all of the hurt

"Dear Abi,

**""We met for a reason, either you're a blessing or a lesson."" -Frank Ocean**

When we first met I had no idea my heart would react in this way. I thought you had a special untapped talent and I wanted to see you succeed. As time went by and learned more about you these feelings started to take hold. Our current situation has me trying to figure out if this is a blessing or a lesson.

**""Find someone who grows flowers in the deepest parts of you""**

Of course you are absolutely beautiful but these feeling run some much deeper. As I learned how much you love your family and love God the feelings really started to grow. The more time we spent together the more I learned that our goals and values are aligned. Your love kids and have a goal of starting a family while working towards your professional goals is exactly what I was looking for in a partner. 

**""Joy is “the feeling we have from doing what we are fashioned to do,” no matter the outcome."" -Matthew McConaughey** 

The way that you are dedicated to your ambitions and way that you push yourself to be the best is incredible. Watching you grow as a person over the past few months has been great to see. I love your goofy ways it always brings a smile to my face. Your joy for life is so infectious it always improves my day each time that I see you. Joy is the feeling that I have when spending time with you.

**“We met at the wrong time. That’s what I keep telling myself anyway. Maybe one day years from now, we’ll meet in a coffee shop in a far away city somewhere and we could give it another shot.” -Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind**

If we continue on this path, the above thought will be left in my mind for the rest of my life. It has been killing me on the inside that I am not allowed see if you feel the same. Maybe you don't feel the same and that would be fine but not being able to find out is significantly worse than any rejection could ever be. I hope to tell you how I feel one day but I will likely be too late. 

**We were doomed to be star-crossed lovers; destined to wonder what might have been**

I leave you with this advice: Choose someone who loves God like you do. He will lead you towards a deeper relationship with Jesus and will not lead you astray towards the sin of the flesh. 

**""Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her""                -Ephesians 5:25**

&lt;p&gt;The way that you are dedicated to your ambitions and way that you push yourself to be the best is incredible. Watching you grow as a person over the past few months has been great to see. I love your goofy ways it always brings a smile to my face. Your joy for life is so infectious it always improves my day each time that I see you. Joy is the feeling that I have when spending time with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We met at the wrong time. That’s what I keep telling myself anyway. Maybe one day years from now, we’ll meet in a coffee shop in a far away city somewhere and we could give it another shot.” -Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we continue on this path, the above thought will be left in my mind for the rest of my life. It has been killing me on the inside that I am not allowed see if you feel the same. Maybe you don&amp;#39;t feel the same and that would be fine but not being able to find out is significantly worse than any rejection could ever be. I hope to tell you how I feel one day but I will likely be too late. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We were doomed to be star-crossed lovers; destined to wonder what might have been&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I leave you with this advice: Choose someone who loves God like you do. He will lead you towards a deeper relationship with Jesus and will not lead you astray towards the sin of the flesh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her&amp;quot;                -Ephesians 5:25&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You Duke Calhoun &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Be Kind and Have Courage&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When you smile, you become my law.

"That's the type of love I can understand and almost define perfectly. But what about the love for your best friends? Or old flames? Or your love for hobbies, ideas, etc.

The L word is just so complicated and overly used. It loses its elusive meaning the more its used interchangeably when a different word would suffice. 

I want you to know that I think I love you. I love the way you talk to me, I love the way you see me, I love how you make me laugh and feel amazing inside of my warm soul. You are like my soul sister/predisposed lover. Like its meant to be and there was nothing we can do to escape it. 

I want to open up to you and tell you stuff, I want to ask you about all the same things and get your deep and meaningful reactions/thoughts on everything.

What do I have to do to show you that I am here for you and you only and I wont be leaving? I don't think there's anything I can do except be there for you everyday and show you by example. You are mine. You make my world go around. 

If you didn't want to be with me I would respect it, slow down, and be your friend. But until you tell me that you are straight up mine and I will keep you forever as long as you let me. 

I promise you I will not hurt you. I promise you that I don't know exactly what love is. But there is no interchangeable word that would fit better than I love you sweetheart. I would do anything for you. I will give it all for you. Its not obsession, though I am quite obsessed, Its definitely something primal, unique, and unforgettable.

 Hey now do you see me down the way  
Been watching you everyday

I know you better that way  
One day I'll be meeting you for real  
You'll feel bad like I feel

Hey now well I'm knocking on your door

Hello, I got something for you

It'll blow you away  you're gonna fall for me  
And the voices told me  
To blow you away - you're gonna fall for me

If you hadn't sold me  
I'd still be away - you're right in front of me   
Then, I'll be on my way  
Breathing you okay

"we now live in different states and my memories have begun to fade and so have our conversations. i cling to the sweet moments like sand slipping from my grip but its the bitter bits that get stuck and remian like some gunked-up goop clogged in my brain. 

i barely remember what we would laugh about but I think I'll always remember when you called me from his friends wedding crying about how he caused a big scene where he threatened your relationship and then gaslit you all in front of his friends and then left you on your own. or how he drove out to the backwoods and fucked that gross fifty something year old who I helped you track down because you were suspicious after he brought you lunch and flowers at work out of the blue and we found out that that was right before he drove off and cheated on you. 

i wish I could but I can't forget all those times you found him on grimy dating sites or discovered his dms to his female coworkers. my brain won't erase you telling me he said he didn't love you anymore or about those times that he packed his shit up and left you with the bill because he said you wouldn't let him breath or something like that.

i still remember his cyclical tendencies. how you would call me afterwards so happy that he had come back and was being so romantic and full of all the apologies and sweet words and pretty promises and how you thought that things were finally going to change this time but I always knew they wouldn't and you always called when they didn't. saying ""I should have listened to you"". So listen to me now (you won't) But I'll tell you anyways ((because i'm in love with you))

i don't really know why you even asked for my advice. i think you always knew what i would do if i were you, but you still called me anyways and we would talk for hours and you would always agree with me and for some reason i still held onto a stupid shred of hope that you would finally break away because you were a wiltered flower in the spring of your life who had rooted to a narcissistic parasite and i was subjected to watching you wilter and die inside while i was doing the same but for your sake I was pretending that I was okay and that nothing had changed. ""I'm trying to date. I'm just picky. Yeah I'm doing great. I've just been busy"" 

i wish you never flattered me with compliments on my looks or my personality. i wish you never told me that the night you and him crashed at my place you left the guest-room door cracked open while you were having sex because you were hoping i would join for the night. Did you really think I wasn't gonna read into that? You knew I wanted to beat his ass and you're too smart not to have thought that i must have loved you, so what kind of sick fucked up bullshit was that?? 

with all those little lines between the lines and your subtle tones through the phone, can you even really blame me?

i wish you never told me about how you were afraid to leave him because you didn't think you could attract a good man. i wish you didn't always tell me what a good man i am (was) and how ""any girl would be lucky to be with you"". because i made puzzle pieces out of all those things you said and they always constructed a beautiful future of me and you and now I don't know that that's the truth. 

i wanted to tell you everything before i finally did but you were so cracked and vulnerable and your dad had just been diagnosed with cancer and your lover was on his bullshit again and you seemed to need me in a way that i couldn't bring myself to deny from you because i felt you cracking and needing comfort and glue and i thought i could hold you together even though i was breaking me in two and when i finally sent you that letter I think I waited weeks maybe months for your response and i pretended like i didn't think that you must had received it and I think I asked but you ducked and dodged and maybe even lied. what letter? never mind. 

but in december of 2020 the pressure and pain finally did me in and i broke like a fractured dam compulsively flooding all my wildest emotions and delusions and dreams and all my darkest secrets and scars and shames straight to Facebook. it wasn't all about you but a lot of it was and i didn't say your name but i don't think i really needed to. we were so close that i think all our friends already knew how i felt about you so i sent you those texts telling you i was done with the games and knew you were ashamed to give up on 8 years even if it was filled with hurt because you could see beneath the pain and red flags and you were determined to fix him and i told you i loved you for that and there would be a good man waiting for you if you ever wanted a give a shot at something different. but for my sake i had to insist that we not talk again until you finally confronted this. i think i'll probably have to wait forever or until my brain snaps in two (again) leaving me unglued (again) 

i was high for months after that night and thought i was gifted premonisions through which i could manipulate your eventual decisions. i was unhinged and i was wrong but i kept sharing song after song straight to my story choosing 15 seconds of lyrics that i thought were written about me and should be sung for you. you watched every story like a stalker in my dark and i felt pretty clever and gifted but after those months gravity began to pull me back down and i realized i was the one who had become completely unglued because you were still warm in the arms of your abuser and i was (still am) out in the cold feeling used but also suffering the gut wrenching withdrawals of just another habitual addict. shit, even my drug addiction was easier to kick than this. 

i can kind of still remember some of the good times like when we first became friends and we would hangout at the bar all night at all those shows as our friends band played up there on the stage and we'd laugh and smoke cigarettes and relate about different things and occasionally we'd do a little cocaine and that would be our little secret and it would help us spill more of our little secrets which drew us closer together until maybe it seemed a little weird to our friends because your boyfriend was on the stage plugged into an amp and playing on his guitar but i didn't have no scummy intentions even though i could feel the infatuation invading into my brain because the signs of abuse hadn't shown and i couldn't bring myself to push me away because you were at every show and so was i. 

our mutual friends forced us together like some force of gravity or fate and eventually we became so close that you'd call me on the phone at like 9pm and we would laugh over silly stories and secrets until it was like midnight or 1am and a couple days later we'd get together in some parking lot to smoke a cigarette and a couple bowls or a few hits from the pen and few days later we would meet at the bar at another show and do it all over again 

i moved across state lines to allow us room to grow 

it didn't really work because those late night calls continued for years until i finally broke and i still miss you like every day no matter the medications i take or any of the mantras i say

i'm sorry, my love 

but i still need this distance

i'm sorry

"""I will never forget your name. I wishper to myself softly as I'm taking the laundry out. My thoughts are damp and heavy just like the clothes I'm putting on the dryer. ""You are my sunshine"" you said to me and i truly believed it. 

Today is different. There's no sunshine in me or at least i can't see the tiny rays of light through the flock of clouds i created for myself. I never thought that I'm going to be the one that pushes you away and i was fighting just to keep your heart closer to mine but my heart is like a lonely bird and it will never ever rest, only stops when it needs to be fed. 
You can't hold a bird in your hand only to feel it gasping for air as your palm slowly closes over it.
""I'm drowning"" you laughed so hard when I said this to you in the shower but the truth is that I'm still suffocating under the weight of your love. 

Your love is different. Your love is warm like summer days, your love is orange coloured and tastes like sweet and sour nectar in my mouth. Your love is like your hand, so strong it could easily snap my throat but you're the one who decides how firm is your grip.

I need bird love. I need the brushing of feathers and the open air to fly together. Bird love is soft pink and baby blue like the sky on a spring morning. Bird love is an open palm and I don't want to be afraid of this palm closing. 


You said you know we're not ment to be and I wanted to trick myself into thinking you're wrong. You're never wrong. Your grip started to get stronger and i am not ready to embrace your tightness, I can't let you bond in me even deeper. 

When I rushed out of bed the last time you were here i felt like the only thing worse than you not being with me is that in fact that you're laying next to me. It hurts letting you go but being with you feels like drowning and i want to keep my head above water. 

I'm not ready. I realised i only love the Idea of you and i will never fit in your idea of me as well. I still cherish every moment we spent together as i letting your hands slip off of me. 
I will never forget your name. Let us fly.""

" I was lying in bed on my side. It was dim. I rolled over to my other side and she was there, looking at me. Intently. 

For some reason, I felt like something had to be said. I rolled my eyes. ""Hey, I want to tell you something but please promise me you're not going to be awkward about it"" 

""what is it?"" she asked curiously. 

""I like you--"" I paused. For something I've felt for a long time, those words just flowed out of me naturally, a little too nonchalantly. I gazed deeply into her eyes. My heart drops, just for a moment, in a bit of shock, I've just now realized the gravity of what I've said. I hesitate, close my eyes and take a deep breath. I muster up all the courage I have left and I continue.  ""I really do like you but it doesn't matter anyway."" I dismiss myself. ""Please don't be awkward about it because I can pretend that I don't."" 

""I've always pretended that I didn't anyway; and I'd like to think that I've actually succeeded in this. I'm not the type who wants to jump around and rock the boat, L."" I shift my gaze to the wall behind her, and I come back to her. ""Just relax, you don't have to put anything into what I said. I just wanted to finally say my peace, and quite frankly, I just want to get over this feeling. Because I think this feeling just has to be heard, and I can get over it already."" 

Silence. For what felt like an eternity. I was trying to figure out how she's responding to all of this. After all, it was something I felt so deeply, and I think she knew this, too. 

After a few seconds, she squinted her eyes, brought her eyebrows together ever so lightly, still, curiously. She then did this sort of a half grin, with the dimple on her right cheek out prominently. Side note -- I had a crush on her because of this. 

She closed her eyes, and nodded gently, ""Okay."" 

I was relieved? I really didn't know how I felt. I was still trying to process it all. 

Her reply was the cute ""okay"" she says when she's a few drinks in, the last time I saw her let go and be happy. I knew for a fact that she was entirely sober in my dream, though.

"Thank you for opening up to me and making me feel like you actually care and want to have a conversation. Thank you for not ghosting me. Thank you for being my friend. I really really really like you not sure if you can tell. 

I'm not pulling back , also not pressuring. I hope this is comfortable for you. Sorry I'm awkward. 

Sometimes I wonder how things can change so much in a few months. I wonder sometimes what would've happened if we hit it off right away, but something is telling me that maybe we needed each other at this specific time and fate played us a hand. IDK

I might've lied when I said I'm not holding back but that's the only lie I've told you. I just want to text you all the time and blow up your phone. I don't wanna suffocate you with my rants or weird stuff. Maybe you wouldn't mind? Either way its important to me that you know if I'm not texting right away its only because I'm trying to make sure this works. I don't wanna lose you 

I am a big mouth. I am a blabber mouth. My buddy's call me Hagrid. Yeah they are nerds. But its because I'm always like "" I shouldn't have said that"" 

I'm not sure if this makes sense to you but I want you to be the person that I blab to. I have to keep a lot of secrets and when I don't have a best friend I split the secrets between a hundred people and next thing you know I'm just an asshole who opens his mouth too much lol.

"I love you,

I have loved you since the first day we met. I didn’t believe in love at first sight until I met you. It wasn’t your beauty that made me fall in love with you. It wasn’t anything superficial.   
It was your eyes.  
Looking into your eyes I saw more than just your beauty. I saw your soul, I saw you, and now I see you everywhere I go. You are bound to my heart and will be from that day until forever. In your eyes I saw your heart, your kindness, your passion, and your energy. That was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Each time I look in your eyes, I am yet again mesmerized. 

It has been an absolute pleasure and honor to get to know you and be with you over the last few months. You never seize to amaze me.   
I remember the first time we went to get coffee together. You held the door open for an elderly couple to come out first, and then let me in.

I remember the first time we kissed. We kissed for a few seconds and after we pulled away, you gave me one more peck as if to reassure me, this was no accident. You held me tightly around my waist, but gently around my face. It was the best kiss of my life and I will never forget it.

I remember the first time we made love. You made sure I felt safe, you listened to me, and paid attention to my needs. I felt seen, I felt special, I felt loved. 

I remember the first time I met your family. They already knew so much about me, I could tell you talked about me. It made me feel wanted and appreciated. It already felt like my home, I was so welcomed. 

Every moment since the first day we met, I have loved. I was born twice in my life. Once 32 years ago, and another time when I met you. 

Thank you for sharing this life with me, this love with me, and sharing you with me.

"Oh, Dear Mr. Decent

Ara ara, welcome to this not-so-sad-yet-it-makes-me-sentitive storytime! Kicking off with a littke bit of context, I (19M) have a newly (for me) discovered kind of crush for Mr. Decent (just created this account and thought about the sweet irony of it), who is a classmate of mine at uni (he's 20M). He's also straight. Nonetheless, before going on the 'oh, I fell for a straight guy' thingy, I'll tell you that throughout my teenages and their hormonal changes I had several 'crushes' (and let's draw some lines here, Crush != True Crush and Crush != Personal Crush and Personal Crush != True Crush, got it? I'll explain along the way) who were nothing more than guys who had sex appeal or actors, dot. 

For guys who I met irl and qualified for it, it was quite stingy to have my attention driven away and my hormones going crazy for them, but as long as the dopamine hit ended, I was fine. It was like that for most of my teenages until I fell in love for a long-distance person, but I actually didn't. My first love was someone who I idealized and became emotionally dependent on. 3 years (with interruptions) of that babe; it made me go through a lot, and I knew what emotions were. Nowadays I've went throught a lot of emotional healing and that person and I solved things, I don't hate him (let's call him L for reference purposes) anymore.

A True Crush is someone I really feel bad for not being with, normally associated with having developed something with that person, Remember L? You go with that. A person can be Crush, True Crush, and Personal Crush at the same time, btw.

Now... A Personal Crush. *Sigh*


Mr. Decent and I met in person 7 months ago. Before that, I had seen his photos on social media and was, not gonna lie, immediateky attracted just because he's got the sex appeal that's 90% my type. He became a Crush and time went by. I was able to completely forget about him for a long time because a) I didn't know we were classmates on some courses, b) It was back on quarantine that I saw the photo, c) It was only a photo, nothing special about a dopamine hit. Now, when lockdows ended and we started going to on-site classes at uni, we met. I was shocked, to say the least, that we were gonna spend like 7 to 10 hours weekly together (we take the same commute route, he actually lives 10 min on foot from my house), but at the end of the day I didn't mind it much as I had already processed the dopamine hit beforehand.

He turned out to have much more to him than just sex appeal. His IQ is beautiful, he's got moral values, he's assertive, thoughtful, masculine, methodic, and... I could go on. We've been developing a friendship, and I really do feel some just-friendly vibes to him... But he's so much more special. Special enough to shine my day with just a smile, or to make me undoubtely sensitive when he's around. What I feel for him is, on one side, very much personal.

On the other side, I am, and have been devoid of physical, caring touch for all my life (I do have a loving family, but one of my biggest dreams is just to lie in bed with a soul that resonates with mine next to me, in utter peace), and he's become the trigger for that longing.

Disclaimers ahead. 

I do have tested what I feel, what I think I feel, and what I think about him. I am not blind of neurochemicals enough to only see his good side, but that exactly is what makes him a personal crush. I think I've fallen down to mother earth for him.

Second disclaimer is that I know and accept that he's straight, and I know and accept that one can't change other people's sexual orientation, nor approaching him sexually would be less than utterly disrespecful for both him and (more importantly) me, because I don't deserve to be put my heart on my sleeve for everyone to see that I've got a non-corresponded love.

I am here, voicing that I feel all of this in an act of love towards us both.

Now, how did he become 'Mr. Decent'?

Long story short, when I was telling one of my best friends about him, I described him in my head, and syntesized everything I think of him as being a 'Decent' person among everyone, as being more decent than most of the people I have met (I'm saying they're not decent, human people, but surely among the first persons that pop up in my head when I think about it is him, right next to my beloved lady mother). Now, under that definition I'm also Mr. Decent (as I consider myself a decent person as well)...

I'm making this post because I accept what's happening, but my heart tenders when I write about him.

This post is for Mr. Decent, the one who has a part of my heart.

This post also is for Mr. Decent, the one that is writing these lines.

For any homosexual guys or girls that fall for straight people: Acknowledge what is outside your sphere of control, feel what you need to feel, accept your emotions and let yourselves be free, not neglecting, not denying, not suffering, just being.


PD: In my hands is the literal decision to stop seeing Mr. Decent for 8 hours a week next year. I dunno what to do.

PD2: As per the rules, I did not create this account JUST for this post, but I did create it recently. I'll probably be wandering around here for a while. I hope this is reddit-legal.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-11-30T11:57:26.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, Dear Mr. Decent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short, when I was telling one of my best friends about him, I described him in my head, and syntesized everything I think of him as being a &amp;#39;Decent&amp;#39; person among everyone, as being more decent than most of the people I have met (I&amp;#39;m saying they&amp;#39;re not decent, human people, but surely among the first persons that pop up in my head when I think about it is him, right next to my beloved lady mother). Now, under that definition I&amp;#39;m also Mr. Decent (as I consider myself a decent person as well)...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m making this post because I accept what&amp;#39;s happening, but my heart tenders when I write about him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is for Mr. Decent, the one who has a part of my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post also is for Mr. Decent, the one that is writing these lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any homosexual guys or girls that fall for straight people: Acknowledge what is outside your sphere of control, feel what you need to feel, accept your emotions and let yourselves be free, not neglecting, not denying, not suffering, just being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PD: In my hands is the literal decision to stop seeing Mr. Decent for 8 hours a week next year. I dunno what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PD2: As per the rules, I did not create this account JUST for this post, but I did create it recently. I&amp;#39;ll probably be wandering around here for a while. I hope this is reddit-legal.&lt;/p&gt;

"My love, I write to you today to let you know that I have confirmed that what I have been telling you for years, is true. 

Our love will last forever.

There is no better feeling than to hold you in my arms and look in your eyes. I feel as if our souls are connecting and speaking, without words being said. It’s magical. Our connection is true and there is no one I would prefer to spend my days with. Side by side, we can do anything. It does not matter if we are walking, sitting, or on a roller coaster, it is all equally enjoyable to me. 

You once asked me, whether I would love you, even after you die. I can confirm, yes I do. You have passed, and my love is still as strong as ever.   
I can also confirm that my love remains the same, it feels the same to me. When I close my eyes I see you as if you were in front of me. When I sleep, I feel you in my dreams as if it was our honeymoon again. Our souls are bound together. I can confirm this to you, my love.

This has led me to make another important realization. The significance of love, the power of love, the truth of love

Love transcends past our human lifes. For if love was a human construct, how would love last even when one is gone? If our love can last even with your passing, then it must last even after mine has passed. Our love is not bound to our bodies, it is bound to our souls, our energy, us.

We are as much together today as we were on our first day. I feel this and know it to be true. This means we will be as much together, even when I have taken my last breath.

Although I do not look forward to death, I look forward to being with you again under similar circumstances. I do enjoy having you in my heart, and by my side. However, I do miss spending our days together.   
I miss reading with you. I miss watching our favorite TV shows. I miss sleeping in, waking up and laughing together in bed. I miss Christmas day with you and our kids. They miss your cooking (and of course you).

I look forward to being with you again, but will make the best of my time here. For when we reunite, there will be no more physical separation, only love. 

Our love is forever.

Love,   
Patrick

P.S. The kids send their love, and I still go for a walk with Luna every morning.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-11-26T23:33:44.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My love, I write to you today to let you know that I have confirmed that what I have been telling you for years, is true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our love will last forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no better feeling than to hold you in my arms and look in your eyes. I feel as if our souls are connecting and speaking, without words being said. It’s magical. Our connection is true and there is no one I would prefer to spend my days with. Side by side, we can do anything. It does not matter if we are walking, sitting, or on a roller coaster, it is all equally enjoyable to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You once asked me, whether I would love you, even after you die. I can confirm, yes I do. You have passed, and my love is still as strong as ever.&lt;br/&gt;
I can also confirm that my love remains the same, it feels the same to me. When I close my eyes I see you as if you were in front of me. When I sleep, I feel you in my dreams as if it was our honeymoon again. Our souls are bound together. I can confirm this to you, my love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has led me to make another important realization. The significance of love, the power of love, the truth of love&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love transcends past our human lifes. For if love was a human construct, how would love last even when one is gone? If our love can last even with your passing, then it must last even after mine has passed. Our love is not bound to our bodies, it is bound to our souls, our energy, us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are as much together today as we were on our first day. I feel this and know it to be true. This means we will be as much together, even when I have taken my last breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I do not look forward to death, I look forward to being with you again under similar circumstances. I do enjoy having you in my heart, and by my side. However, I do miss spending our days together.&lt;br/&gt;

"I miss you this evening. I try to push away the intrusive thoughts about whether or not you miss me too…I’m 99% you do not…it shouldn’t matter. It really doesn’t…I think it must be a craving for validation that all those times I was vulnerable with you, loving with you, affectionate, open, naked in every way with you, really were special and meant something…they weren’t just for nothing. You shared all those things with me too and, I feel that you are amazing. It was real, when you looked deeply into my eyes…I love you. Despite the huge mess that this became towards the end, I love you so much. I know, it didn’t reflect in my behaviour at the end and it makes me sound ridiculous. I know that I well and truly burnt the bridge between us…the silence was killing me. You were always so warm…I felt as though I was home when I was near you. A cliche, I know. Or ‘soppy’ as you say…

I was remembering that night when you’d had a beer after passing your driving test, and you got emotional…we talked and you said, you really didn’t want to f*ck this up. I think we both did. It makes me so sad…sad with more acceptance now, how over this really is. I remember saying that we’d be ok because our communication was amazing…god it really went the opposite way at the end. I just want to wrap my arms around you and nestle into your neck…we were always the perfect height for each other…I feel we were perfect for each other in so many ways…but not the situation…and it’s like I said, I know I’ve burnt that bridge and I know that I didn’t help things and I was so full of anger right at the end but please understand…I felt like I’d meant nothing to you, I felt so used.

"Happy Birthday Meebee!

Not that any of this is news to you, but I love you. It's been stressful, knowing I can't physically be there with you for your birthday this year. I can only hope this is a gift you'll cherish for the rest of our lives.

I love you, Meebee. You know, it was embarrassingly early that I first wanted to say it. Even to me, the person feeling it, it felt stupid to say. How could it have been love already?? But there was too much about you that was spot on, exactly what I desired. Exactly what I'd always needed my whole life. Everything. And I wasn't wrong back then - I did love you so soon. And I've never felt happier in my life since meeting you. I've had enough unfavourable experiences in my life to recognise what you offer.

I've lived through love and heartbreak, pain and joy. With every day that has gone by, I've watched myself grow, and my partners stagnate. I've watched people I have committed my life to, give me nothing close to that. And I've watched myself give and give, and I've never received anything in return.

And then, you came along.

All this time, I've forgone my own interests, because they have not been shared.

All this time, I've kept ideas and conversations to myself, or at most, short and brief. There's never been anyone there to return serve. Nobody to hold the conversation with me. Nobody to challenge my thinking.

All this time, I've lacked confidence, in everything. Myself, my abilities, my potential.

And I thought it as all normal. I thought I was asking too much to think that any of that could be better. But you've changed it all. My perception of what I should consider 'normal', has drastically shifted.

We have shared interests, first of all. Enough of them to keep us busy for a long, long time. And even a few interests we don't share, but, wouldn't you know it - we both are devoted enough to each other to open up and share in those new experiences. I swear, the day you can predict a premier league result with astrology, I'll pass out. And I know it's coming, you smartass...And you know I'm gonna beat your ass one day on the bike track, right?

Second, the conversations we have are off the charts! Whether it's relationship and life desires, or it's some controversial topic, or it's quite literally teaching each other things - it's perfect. We agree, we disagree, we respectfully debate, and we are both open minded enough to shift our thinking if we begin to see flaws in our own logic.

And finally, for this post anyway, your intelligence is like nobody I've ever met. You can match me on so many levels, and exceed me on many others. Of course along with that, is a matching humour, and highly energetic banter - I wouldn't have it any other way. The mental stimulation is like nothing I've ever felt.

You're immaculate, you're intelligent, you're adorable, you're elegant. You're perfect, for me. Just, perfect.

So today, on your birthday, please know I love you more than I can put into words. And I've tried my hardest - because I know you love words. I love you. Actually I've loved 'you' all my life, I just didn't know 'you' could actually exist. And I'm the happiest person on earth, now that you've found me, and opened my eyes to just how perfect a life-long partnership can be.

Thank you for being you. Thank you for being with me. Thank you letting me call you 'mine'. I love you!",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-10-21T20:20:07.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Birthday Meebee!&lt;/p&gt;

And I&amp;#39;m the happiest person on earth, now that you&amp;#39;ve found me, and opened my eyes to just how perfect a life-long partnership can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for being you. Thank you for being with me. Thank you letting me call you &amp;#39;mine&amp;#39;. I love you!&lt;/p&gt;

"Dear M.T.

  I’ve never sat down and just wrote my feelings out. So if this gets off topic I apologize!:)

  M.T., you are my favorite person in this whole world! Every single thing we’ve been through will stay with me for the rest of my life. You are so special and the most beautiful perfect human being I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. The way you laugh, smile, drink, live, sleep, everything you do is special to me. In the moment I only want to be with you forever(I know it’s not smart right now it’s just how I feel). In my heart you are my soulmate! And you always will be no matter how you think of me. 

  I’ve never loved someone as deep as I love you. You’ve taught me how to be vulnerable and how to open up and I’m truly grateful for that. You’ve shown me how to love. I can not tell you enough how important you are to me. 

  Even if we’ve had some hard times. Being with you has been the best thing to ever happen to me. You’ve helped guide me through the past 7 years and I wish I could spend a million more with you! Right now all I see in my future is you!

  I don’t want to sound cliche but if I could turn back time and give you everything you deserve plus more I would in a heartbeat! I know you’ve been struggling with being sweet towards me and that’s perfectly fine! I hope you can forgive me. You deserved so much more and I didn’t realize until it was too late. All my life I’ve heard the saying “you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone” and I never took it serious. That is the truest statement I’ve ever heard.

  I’m sitting here crying and writing this letter to you. I feel like I’m not the best at speaking my true feelings and I hope the letter can do that for me! I just want to hug you man. I want to sleep in the same bed with you. I want to plan trips and hear about your day while I run your feet(even though I freaking hate feet) yours are different. There’s not a single part of your body that i don’t absolutely love.

  Everything about you is amazing! I could literally right a book on all the things I love about you. You are my first true love! I r never felt this strongly for someone and I don’t think I ever will again. You will forever hold a special place in my heart! I will be here for you until the day I die.

  No matter what you have to do to heal yourself it will never affect the way I feel about you. I really hope you can forgive me. I’ve recognized and acknowledged the ways I’ve hurt you. I truly don’t want you to be just a learning experience. YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT!

  It took my brain multiple months before it actually processed what happened. I think about you 24/7! No matter what I’m doing or how much fun I’m having you’re the only thing on my mind. I will always be here for you mentally, emotionally, physically, and financially. You will never be forgotten or not loved! I will always be that person for you!

  I’ve seen you catch yourself when you’re being nice to me and I’m not sure if you’re doing that for me or for you. Whatever the case I don’t want you feeling that way. We can be sweet to each other without it turning in to anything besides friendship. I don’t want you to feel like I’m trying to push you back into our relationship when I’m being nice or buying you things. I do those things because I truly love you no matter what state our relationship is in.

  MT, I LOVE YOU and I truly believe in my heart that you will be in my life no matter the status of our relationship. I’m holding on to that thought because the idea of you being a stranger breaks my fucking heart. I hope we can grow together in the future!

  I just got off the phone with you! I’m so happy that’s still an option. I can tell you’re still upset with me and I want nothing more than at least a healthy relationship with you. I’m not sure if that even made sense lol. I miss seeing how happy you were to see me. It was the best feeling the whole world! Now that it’s gone I realized I took you for granted and got comfortable. In my head I truly believed you would never leave me. That was my biggest mistake. Now that I don’t have you and I can’t call you my person it’s made me realize how special you are and everything you deserve that I wasn’t giving you. I know I’ve said this but I really hope you can forgive me for not listening to you when I had the chance. The last thing I want is for you to NOT love me.

"Young college students, in July, learning French in country…

A trip I had saved years for…

Beautiful parks, excursions, food, music, art, history all around us, every day. 

Paris is always a good idea indeed!

You had a girlfriend, and I didn’t fancy myself a home wrecker. 

But looking back, knowing that relationship didn’t last for you… I wish I had it to do over again. 

I wish I had kissed you with abandon in the hedge labrinth. In the evening candlelight in Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte. In the Jardin de Luxembourg. Everywhere I could pull you into a nook and press your inviting, sensual lips to my own. 

Made love to you in every way possible. Created memories that would keep me warm at night when I become old, and think of you. A liaison to remember. 

But alas, we do the best we can with what we know at the time. 

I wonder if I’ll ever see you again.

I hope you are well. I hope your life has been good. I hope you had all the adventures you craved!

"To you,

When I told you I loved you the first time, I was nervous. Not because I wasn't sure I would mean it, but because I knew I would. I meant I would always be there for you. I would always have your back. I would always stand by you. On the good days and the bad. I would never be ashamed of you, I would be proud of you and who you are. I'd be your shelter in the storm. Your firm foundation. Your shoulder to cry on. Your ear to bend. Your big bear hug at the end of a long day. Your kiss goodnight.

I knew this all before I said the words. You're my dream girl. Not only because of your beauty (though my heart leaps every time I see you), but also because of who you are and how you make me feel. When I'm with you I feel complete. I feel content. Like I'm right where I'm supposed to be with whom I'm supposed to be with. The universe makes sense. I feel like my self when I'm with you. I’m the man I want to be. You bring out who I really am. Everything fits. In short, you make me happy. You do that just by being you. And I love you for it.

I'm not nervous anymore. You are all that I want and all that I need. Just as you are. I mean that now, I meant it then, and I will mean it tomorrow. Never doubt that. Never forget that. You are loved. You are wanted. By me.

"Jacob,
It's 2 a.m. here and i have college tomorrow, and yet, here i am, writing to you, instead of sleeping.
But that's the problem, JJ, i can never sleep with you in my head, so I'm writing this down, in case I forget in the morning.
I sat on the tree swing where you flew off and broke your arm when you were 10, today. I traced the indentation on the tree where we carved our names. Our sloppy handwriting, side by side. Remember how you came to school with your father's Swiss knife that day? All because we wanted something that would be ours, something that we could share forever, and that damned oak tree was the best thing we could think of.
The school shut down shorty after you moved away, apparently they weren't getting enough students to keep it going, but the tree's still there. I don't know why I went there today, maybe it's because of this ache in my heart, maybe it's because i didn't have anything better to do, maybe it's because i miss you.
Oh Jacob, how i miss you, i haven't seen you in so long, I've started to forget what you look like, but not you, never you.
It's late and the breeze coming in through my window isn't helping, i just wanna crawl back into bed and sleep, but i can't sleep whenever i remember you, which is every night. I should probably see a doctor, maybe they'll prescribe me some sleeping pills. But i don't think that'll help, because then I'll just dream of you, and that would break my broken heart into a thousand little pieces.
I don't know how to describe it, scared, thrilled, full, empty, happy, sad, the feeling i get when i wake up from a dream of you, of us, happy, together, in love.
I probably shouldn't talk about love, because talking about love after 12 a.m. never ends well. But do you remember that time you wrote me a letter but you were too scared to give it to me, so you sent Dave as a messenger and he read it, and made fun of you for calling me 'my little butterfly' for a whole school year? And how you never wrote anything for me again? Dave's a dick, you should have definitely wrote me more.
It's getting late, almost 3 a.m. and i have a presentation tomorrow, so i should probably sleep, but like i said, you steal all my dreams away but a part of me doesn't want to ask you to give them back, cause that's the only way we get to see each other.
I'll end here, cause i can never seem to know when to stop when it comes to you.
Goodnight, JJ

"My darling,

Another stupid poem I am writing to you

A thousand eyes might see, and I hope yours will too

•

""Whoulda thunk"" I'd probably say

That a girl in Venice would make me feel this way

That you, a stranger just like everyone else 

Would leave my head in a chaotic mess

•

But that being said, my dear Anna don't you forget

That I still think about you with no regret

Through all the pain I have to endure

I still love you so deeply, I know for sure

Through all these days that feel so terribly bleak

You'll still excite me more than a GTA 6 leak

•

Also my love, you must apprehend

That I still hope that it's us in the end

I wonder sometimes if you feel just as insane

Reach out to me so I can help ease the pain.

Say any of you readers remember how far back the point is in this Cloud Atlas book becomes movie of my&gt;.. Okay!) Well toady I found my tie in and it all slammed together like like a bacon double cheese burger.

 Jesus Christ is and is not the invisible and visible God most High. How do I know this well for me I find it simple no another god in all I know about god's has successfully done this! I mean come on if one god somehow between all the time he spends using humans for his or her desires and the love of all that is living out debaucheries' and sexual exploits numbers matter here I guess. (how you remind me am I a slut!!?? ... no not at all I am totally demi sexual because the love I feel and wish to give is far too greatly important to have the flame of love get extinguished by the draft of air created by all the up and down pumping. That is and both isn't a joke! Agape the love of my God Jesus Christ who none other than the holy spirit who came down here a became a seed that found an egg that grew a baby that without care for the enduring unthinkable torture and eventually being brutally murder on a cross to curse him in hell. The holy spirit tricked the no match for wisdom only being armed with ignorance.

They whip him repeatedly with dozens of sharp metal talons on the end of each strand of this whip and the finally and in my opinion disgustingly gross act of hate by humans to date and not again ever since, mock belittled and spit on him the entire way. Before he reached the site of his execution. 

Where Jesus Christ the Spirit of the God Most High was nailed foot and hand to a wooden cross where he was baked to death in the desert heat. I could even write this with out welling up because for me and my insane brain I for one in the heart of my heart believe that day happened. The trick be the spirit had worked Jesus Christ the First Living flesh and badly Son of Christ defeated death that day for all of us in the most selfless act of love we will never see again! WWJD if He were here today in the covid driven Fear Fear factor version of the irl afk. We need to band tight we have to find are trust for one another start learning how to trust your disgustingly. So are you a guy or a woman who would given the sandwich from your morning muffin hash brown and coffee (Really what's the muffin without the coffee after freezing all night log.

We have a real shot at taking are planet back showing the ones with all the money, the Law makers the pundits the lobbyist and the elected and of course whatever it is we do here in Canada (Come on don't judge me I have had a lot on my mind beside like Jason Trudeau even knows either!) before the Abomination of Desolation stands where it not ought to be. I think maybe Charles who knows, but the Queen has died and Charles sorry buds your not Cute enough to play the anti Christ William and MI6 will explain this to you I am sure! Love on another Jesus Christ's Last commandment is the key to the heaven we all deep down know is real because if you fear hell there's a heaven and if you love heaven there is most certainly a hell. Start connect right here on Reddit I'll set something up. because hearts and minds is the only way to stop an unbelievable coming bloody tribulation. If we continue on the path we ride so everybody in a very wide line. With a few in a very small and narrow road they are Heaven bound. We are the 99% lets show them how to forgive the worst atrocities that we all are just as responsible for spread evenly over every single living being atm. Love is all you need. You think John Lennon was shot to death by Mark Davidchapman with out someone like an infiltratory his ear lying through his teeth about John Lennon and all the Russians he was working with or whatever it was that offend john's killer. No he was killed because Love is all you actually need!

Say any of you readers remember how far back the point is in this Cloud Atlas book becomes movie of my&amp;gt;.. Okay!) Well toady I found my tie in and it all slammed together like like a bacon double cheese burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus Christ is and is not the invisible and visible God most High. How do I know this well for me I find it simple no another god in all I know about god&amp;#39;s has successfully done this! I mean come on if one god somehow between all the time he spends using humans for his or her desires and the love of all that is living out debaucheries&amp;#39; and sexual exploits numbers matter here I guess. (how you remind me am I a slut!!?? ... no not at all I am totally demi sexual because the love I feel and wish to give is far too greatly important to have the flame of love get extinguished by the draft of air created by all the up and down pumping. That is and both isn&amp;#39;t a joke! Agape the love of my God Jesus Christ who none other than the holy spirit who came down here a became a seed that found an egg that grew a baby that without care for the enduring unthinkable torture and eventually being brutally murder on a cross to curse him in hell. The holy spirit tricked the no match for wisdom only being armed with ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They whip him repeatedly with dozens of sharp metal talons on the end of each strand of this whip and the finally and in my opinion disgustingly gross act of hate by humans to date and not again ever since, mock belittled and spit on him the entire way. Before he reached the site of his execution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Jesus Christ the Spirit of the God Most High was nailed foot and hand to a wooden cross where he was baked to death in the desert heat. I could even write this with out welling up because for me and my insane brain I for one in the heart of my heart believe that day happened. The trick be the spirit had worked Jesus Christ the First Living flesh and badly Son of Christ defeated death that day for all of us in the most selfless act of love we will never see again! WWJD if He were here today in the covid driven Fear Fear factor version of the irl afk. We need to band tight we have to find are trust for one another start learning how to trust your disgustingly. So are you a guy or a woman who would given the sandwich from your morning muffin hash brown and coffee (Really what&amp;#39;s the muffin without the coffee after freezing all night log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have a real shot at taking are planet back showing the ones with all the money, the Law makers the pundits the lobbyist and the elected and of course whatever it is we do here in Canada (Come on don&amp;#39;t judge me I have had a lot on my mind beside like Jason Trudeau even knows either!) before the Abomination of Desolation stands where it not ought to be. I think maybe Charles who knows, but the Queen has died and Charles sorry buds your not Cute enough to play the anti Christ William and MI6 will explain this to you I am sure! Love on another Jesus Christ&amp;#39;s Last commandment is the key to the heaven we all deep down know is real because if you fear hell there&amp;#39;s a heaven and if you love heaven there is most certainly a hell. Start connect right here on Reddit I&amp;#39;ll set something up. because hearts and minds is the only way to stop an unbelievable coming bloody tribulation. If we continue on the path we ride so everybody in a very wide line. With a few in a very small and narrow road they are Heaven bound. We are the 99% lets show them how to forgive the worst atrocities that we all are just as responsible for spread evenly over every single living being atm. Love is all you need. You think John Lennon was shot to death by Mark Davidchapman with out someone like an infiltratory his ear lying through his teeth about John Lennon and all the Russians he was working with or whatever it was that offend john&amp;#39;s killer. No he was killed because Love is all you actually need! &lt;/p&gt;

I'm writing to you in a room full of strangers, because that's how this always happens, me, in a room full of people, yet this perpetual longing for company eating away at my heart remains.
In my room is a Polaroid of the last day we spent together, you, smiling your perfect, gap toothed smile, and me, looking at you, like always. We were happy then, weren't we? No care for the future, as long as we were together, as long as we had each other.
Jacob, i dream of you almost every night, and when i wake up, without dreaming of us, i always feel like a traitor, like i was the one who left, and not the other way around. You know how I am, always getting carried away with dreams and horoscopes, but this morning, i read that a I'll meet a Leo today, who I'll fall head over heels for, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it'll be you, all over again. But who am I kidding? We've already met, amd you've already left.
I walked by our favourite oak tree the other day, the one we carved our names into, remember? It was gone, and when i asked around, they told me they cut it down the other day, i just thought you'd like to know.
I'm coming to meet you today, with my heart in my hand and your promises in my chest. Jacob, this girl writes you every day, she doesn't know how not to, and even though it's been years since the accident, she still talks to you like you haven't stopped breathing, like you haven't been gone for two years.

"Hey you...

I have told you that I love you so many times it is like saying hi or goodbye. 

It came straight from my heart...I meant it every time.

Shelby I loved so many things about you...I swear kissing and hugging you made me high.

I am hurting and crying I can't help it...I am thinking of you and all that I won't ever have again.

I have done so many things with you...I have lost my best friend. 

I have smoked so much weed with you...I never thought this would end.

Shelby... the way you looked at me...I knew I was the one. You couldn't give that look or those eyes to just anyone.

I love you...I loved when you would lean down, your hair would fall to each side and make a tunnel... you looking in my eyes...just me n you...shut the whole world out. 

I loved being close to you, it's what it was all about. Looking into your eyes and I just knew there was no doubt.

If I was trying to be mean I don't know what I would say...I love you in every way.

I can't think of myself and not think of you...I can't think of anything and not think of you. 

I have lost you before, I cried a thousand tears. This pain is so familiar, even though it's been years. 

I was lucky to get you back...I didn't want anyone but you. You are my perfect fit... what else would I do if I didn't have you.

I know why you came back...I know why you returned. It wasn't for true love... you had been burned. You needed a safe place, you needed some help. I took you back...even though I learned.

I didn't care...I loved you...and I knew. I knew you could leave me...I knew you could be without me. I knew you didn't come back for love. I didn't care.

I thought we would make it. After all the years together. I just thought we were past ever losing each other. I never thought anything like this would ever happen. I never thought we would be put to the test. I already know I ain't the one...I know I wasn't the best. I know I can't keep you...there's nothing I can do...once again I have lost you...I have been put to rest.

I miss you so much...I don't have any choice. Shelby I miss the sound of your voice. Now even when you talk to me you are just so mad...I can't talk to you cause I am just so sad.

I am still in here Shelby... the outside isn't me. There's nothing I can do... it just has to be. I know it's not forever...but you're living now. I just have to take it...tho I don't know how. This is as cruel as it can be... it's torturing me.

Thirty-eight years Shelby...I have never kissed another girl...I have never held anyone else's hand. The love I have, I don't understand. I thought I had it all...I have used up my whole life and I have nothing at all. There is no one around me...I am not held dear...no one has cared, and I have been gone for years.

You are the only one I have ever needed. The only one I have ever counted on. FTW...as long as I had you. 

I lost my tools...hard to believe. I had notes in there from you I couldn't retrieve. Seems everything is gone there is not even a trace. Everything that I was has just been erased.

I wish I had the courage to just let you go. I really need the courage to just let myself go. I don't think I can do it...I think that you can. I think it's all left up to you...I am no longer a man. Put an end to it...I know that you can.

I can't blame you for anything. You have done the best that you could. Life has to move on... anyone would.

I am just heart broken Shelby...I am just no good. 

Hey you...I love you babe...I miss you. I would do anything to kiss you. I can't. Not even if you wanted me to. 

I have to stop writing... thanks for the Arby's. I don't know why I deserved it but thank you. 

Thank you for everything Shelby. 

Everyday I say good morning and goodbye. I hope you have a good day and I will see you later. I tell you I love you and I wish you didn't have to go... you can't hear what I say...I just thought you should know...

I'll see you when we get back here...bye",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-09-10T19:41:54.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey you...&lt;/p&gt;

"**This is kind of long, It's a letter to someone I once loved but am now trying to get over.** 

 

When I first met you I was a completely different person than I am today. I was relatively innocent and my mind was easily influenced. 

You thought you were the most important person in the room and I countered that with the thought of us all being insignificant in this small room, city, town. We’d grow up and move away. Some of us would become great, other’s stuck working the classic 9-5 until they’re old and gray. Whoever you thought you were didn’t matter 10 years from now. I was too smart for that class, English 1. I knew I could do better. 

It started when I was sitting in the very back of the classroom without my glasses. I couldn't see anything. I didn’t know you yet but you sat in the front of the other half of the room. I guess that was a sort of symbolism to show the gap between us on the scale of things at the time. I was still relatively un concerned with knowing a lot of people at school, most of the people who were aware of me were just that, aware of me. Whether it was through my more popular friends, elementary school classes, or my sudden appearance during middle school. You didn’t know me though. And I didn’t know you in the slightest. When I was moved to the front into the seat across from you I first heard your voice, it felt as if in the back I couldn’t hear a word you were saying. But here. Front and center, though I didn’t know your face I knew your voice first.

You were loud, funny even. I could tell what type of person you were but I didn’t immediately turn away, I was curious. And that might’ve been the start of my downfall. Curiosity. 

 A week later I had new glasses, they were black and rectangular and ugly. I was still in the hopes of transferring out of that class but I’d developed a connection to our meek teacher. I’d also grown a fascination towards you, often thinking about how I’d miss your jokes if I left. So I told my counselor I was fine where I was. I’d also attached a face to a voice by now. You were dark and your confidence was alluring, for I had not so easily ever had to look someone like you in the face for so long. It was fascinating. 

We were polar opposites, you dressed well and held yourself like you were on top of the world. I had not acquired a fashion sense yet and I shamefully walked the halls, praying nobody saw me. I was a sad person really, I had just learned simple styles to do my hair with and it didn’t help that I'd spent the entirety of summer in a house with nobody but my family. I wanted out, an escape. You felt forbidden almost, and I was being tempted.

I pitied our teacher and made an effort to answer most of the questions as everyone else turned her out or learned in silence. I knew one other person in the class who sometimes helped her out, he was also a close friend of yours and an old classmate of mine. (let's call him Bob) Bob was chill for the most part, he was on the football team with you but acted totally different from the rest of the players. Sure he’d joke around but I’d never heard Bob being as disgusting as his mates. But I also didn’t know him, we had math together in seventh grade but that was about it, never exchanged any words really and he openly let me know that back then he was convinced I was special ed…. Bob tried in class and he had the second highest grade in her class, after me of course. 

This was your second time in this class, our teacher made that known with the familiarity she held with you. I almost felt bad but i’d seen your type a million times before, it was nothing new. So why did I feel so bad about it? It had been only eleven day of school before I asked Bob for your number. I should’ve never done it. Never. But I did and I got your snap. We talked there for a couple hours before exchanging numbers and texting through imessage. You were bold, I do not have these messages anymore but I do remember that.

I made it clear I wasn’t as nerdy as I seemed in our shared class but looking back on myself at that point in life it was a lie. You wanted “things” from me and I was too far into the first stage of my fast and hard addiction towards you. I flirted back, entertained the idea swearing up and down it'll never happen. I was sure of it. Positive even. The texts between messages and snap went on for awhile, I started helping you out in class, obsessing over my hair and lack of good clothing. I told my friends about you to a certain extent leaving out that fact that I had you as a saved contact. When I asked you about yourself I didn’t like the response. I found it boring and it matched the way to present yourself exactly. What kept me hooked was the way you countered yourself constantly, sure the obscene gestures you’d present in class were nothing but immature and vile but I thought it was funny me being the same way secretly. 

I remember the day our teacher trusted you with a new seat, the one directly beside me. I panicked going up to her after class. She knew I liked you. I know she did. She then asked me something I’d never given a thought to before. “Are you sure you can handle sitting by him?” she said she’d sat you beside me because she knew I could deal with your personality, with fear of her moving you without missing a beat I said yes. I wanted you there. 

The next bit of this is gross. I can’t ever think about this day without almost bringing myself to tears, it was the day I changed a lot as a person. September 10th. You kept hinting at it during class, I was a little scared to shut you down, I wanted you to continue acknowledging me. Looking back I should've asked to changed seats immediately. There was no advice in the world that would’ve gotten me to do it though.

 I said yes and as soon as the bell rang you got up urging me to follow you. I had little to no time to reflect and really think about what I was doing. You were walking so fast I left my friend in the other class trailing behind my speed walk to keep up to you. She asked where I was going, what the hell I was doing. I honestly didn’t know. It was a friday. I know that much, See I’m the type of person to really think about all the possible consequences to my choices before doing them. I knew who you were, I knew what you were too. A literal whore. 

When we got to the gym I saw my cousin and my friend staying there, I hesitated “**Are you coming**?” I continued walking. We got to the place and you stared at me, my mouth went dry and I wanted to cry and leave. 

Two sides of myself fighting each other one telling me to leave and stop being stupid and the other dangerous side telling me that i’d gone too far to stop now that i couldn’t be a pussy, was I a pussy? I wish I was in that moment, I wish I’d listen to my mind that overthinks to the fullest extreme. “**Are you gonna do it or not?**” ‘*no*’ “**Fuck it**.” 

The next few days were spent crying and beating myself up about it. Was this really me? The worst part about it is that I felt bad about my performance and me being the overachiever I am, I learned absolutely nothing good and did it again. 

 More beating myself up. Now the problem was I was hooked on you. I’d never done even so much as kissed anyone and so I developed a fast attachment to you. I am always locating wherever you happen to be in the area. Not to be creepy but to keep myself from wondering. I just liked being aware. 

I continued to help you in class but you quickly made my life hell only it didn’t quite reach me. “Friday” that asshat nickname. I knew who was aware of what happened and who wasn’t. Yet I didn’t care because I only really gave a rat’s ass about what you thought. Sure I hated it and cried about it, but it didn’t really matter considering it never left the classroom. I still continued to go to your games and help you with work. 

   Jumping towards november we were working on a project together and I went on my phone. I remember hearing the back and forth but I didn’t realize who it was between at the time brushing it off as you and Bob going at it at one another. It wasn’t Bob. When you stood up, I instantly noticed the cold air that hit my shoulder. I looked up and my heart sunk. Though we talked you into sitting down the second you turned away he hit you, that was the end of that. You swung on him and beat him into the ground, he was a pretty big dude, bigger than Bob. He fell hard; my desk sliding across the room with me in it. I jumped up and eventually removed myself from the situation. This was bad. With all the fights that had happened, expulsion was a likely scenario considering your cousin has jumped in to help. I knew this. 

You weren't at school the next day but it was all anyone was talking about. I texted you in a bit of a panic checking up and all that. Our teacher expressed how she was going to try her best to save you in her statement but I knew that might not be enough, it was out of her job description. I often forget this bit but I wanted to share it anyway. I remember reading the report she wrote and cringing at the bits that could possibly be used against you. I couldn’t with good conscience turn this into your administrator and hope for the best. So I went upstairs and explained the situation to a trusted teacher who often helped me get away with things. He helped me edit and reprint her statement to make you look better. I then delivered it to your administrator, our now principal. This part is grosser than anything else I’ve said leading up to this point. I remember asking her how it was looking, she couldn’t go into details. I was not kin nore your girlfriend or whatever. I introduced myself as someone who was just concerned with no ill intent. I wasn’t happy with the answer I got but I knew that statement was enough to get you off the hook even a little bit. I could never tell you this, it seems obsessive and weird. I kind of am though if you couldn't tell from the get go.

To sum it up you were expelled to the other school for 45 days. That was way less than everyone else was getting so I was happy. What didn’t help was our teacher bringing it up every single day and then proceeding to drag me into the conversation. We spoke while you were out maybe once or twice. 

I attempted to unattach myself from you during this time as well. I knew your type very well. I had a few failed talking stages, most of them being ruined by your friends bringing what I did with you up to them or me subconsciously comparing them to you and completely losing attraction if I thought for a second you’d just laugh at them. I needed someone you more or less respected. 

Around this time I’d also taken a bigger liking towards drugs, often showing up to school and work high off my ass. It was nice, but I also didn’t get much school work done. It was pretty bad. I was sad, everything in the months prior distracted me from myself and being left alone with these thoughts in my addict ass subspace wasn’t a good mix. I tried to get out of it but it was just so comforting. The dropping of my grades was enough to put stress and anger into the mix. I was not making smart choices. 

   I eventually shut down and ended up in the emergency room. I spent the majority of that time crying and thinking about how weirded out you would be if you knew. I also plotted on killing myself the first three days. I could do nothing but sit there, eat, sleep, and read the same book over and over again. I did just that, mostly sleeping and sometimes being able to color. That place was really fucking weird and all I wanted to do was leave. I didn’t deserve to be there, it was literal hell. This is around the time you came back to school. I knew it was your return week and I was in the hospital for the entirety of it. When I got out I saw you in the commons at school and any attempt to forget you was tossed out the window. The second day I saw you, you happened to also see me “**I know that’s not \_\_\_\_\_**.” I said Hey. That was a mistake as well. 

I was not the same person I was when we first met. I believed you were on top of the world. The most important person in the room. You had big things waiting for you and everyone in our school knew it. You were somebody and the world didn’t know it yet. 

We had moved to a new area the day I was released. My dog had also given up whilst I was gone. I didn't feel much as things were moving very quickly and I didn’t have much time to process. It just so happens that you live a few minutes away from me, a minute drive at most, maybe a 10-15 minute walk if you’re a slow walker. This was bad. 

  We rode the same bus now. At the time I was so happy about it even though I never said it outloud. We had different classes but I still had to see you on the daily, it wasn’t long before you realized what a score it was for you and eventually you showed up at my house.

   I’d told you I was a virgin before but you didn’t care enough to remember so when you asked on this day I lied. I didn’t cry, I didn’t want you to know. 

  I must've done something right because that day turned into once a week which turned into whenever you didn’t have a game or practice. It bled into the summer and you were over often. Me and my friend, the same one who all those months ago all but ran behind me to stop me from following you helped me take the car and you and him and would come over, a “two man” I guess or whatever. It was fun, we smoked, we drove around. We never really went anywhere but I still wasn’t too into parties or any of that shit so it didn’t really matter to me. I was addicted to every part of you and the summer was a haze. I cried and screamed. I pleaded with myself to stop. I knew nothing good would come out of it.

  That must've been the same side of me that told me to walk away back on September 10th. I tried. Fuck. You know I tried, I told you the truth, I cried to my friends about it, I cried to my grandma about it. Yet I just didn’t know when to quit. 

 Before school ended I saw you walking with her, I was in front of yall and heard the entirety of the conversation. I was pissed for the most part. But I all but prayed it didn’t go anywhere. We weren’t anywhere close to being something. I was stupid to hope because now I see you two everywhere. In the process of straightening my schedule out I ended up with the same lunch and now I sit with people I couldn’t give less of a fuck about as our friendship ran dry years prior and the punishment for doing stupid shit being to watch you talk and walk with her as I sit there in pain while I'm burdened with trying to figure the fuck out how to abort this baby before it’s too late. 

  Oh I know you remember recent events well. I told you and you looked at me stupid. Accused me of being with other people- well you were not entirely wrong but one of those “people” was a girl and the other I did no more than make out with. So that shit really hurt. I even in my darkest moment went as far as to attempt to talk to you and see if you had any input, ideas, support even. But no as everything goes you blamed me and made me feel like shit. I grew tired of being so nice to you. I’ve always been so fucking nice. I told you that I didn’t care if you were with “her’ because she really is a nice girl. I told you I didn’t want the kid. I told you I’d keep it since you’re providing no help with this shit. I don't want a baby. I cannot have a baby ruin both of our lives. I’m on track to graduating with an associates degree with still little regard for my mental health and you are quite literally one of the best on our football team. 

I wouldn’t want to mess you up..You told me I knew what I was doing, that it was purposeful, you yelled at me. You told me you didn’t want me when at no point did I even HINT at wanting something more. You broke me. I’m so stupid I feel numb towards everything and everyone. I haven’t told my mom I haven’t done anything yet and I’m on a timer.  

 I think I did accomplish one thing though. I don’t care about you anymore. I feel nothing towards you and don’t see how I ever found you exciting. You’re a dumbass jock. I’m not the type to hold grudges so I release everything now. I know I loved everything about you at some point and the sweet moments we had will always be a part of me. I remember laughing and the times you defended me. I remember when you first showed up to my house rapping a song I now listen to daily. I remember changing myself for you, the conversations in my room. I remember when I first saw you. I also remember wishing you truly saw me. Really saw me and all I had to give you. I won’t be bitter, I won't be cruel. I’ll get rid of it and leave you alone. When I start coming back to school I’ll stand by these rules. I won’t bend, I won't fold. I’m a completely different person than I was when you were nothing but a voice, a temptation, a fruit I all but finished before realizing how rotten it truly was. You are nobody in this world and neither am I.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-08-26T01:12:23.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is kind of long, It&amp;#39;s a letter to someone I once loved but am now trying to get over.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first met you I was a completely different person than I am today. I was relatively innocent and my mind was easily influenced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You thought you were the most important person in the room and I countered that with the thought of us all being insignificant in this small room, city, town. We’d grow up and move away. Some of us would become great, other’s stuck working the classic 9-5 until they’re old and gray. Whoever you thought you were didn’t matter 10 years from now. I was too smart for that class, English 1. I knew I could do better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started when I was sitting in the very back of the classroom without my glasses. I couldn&amp;#39;t see anything. I didn’t know you yet but you sat in the front of the other half of the room. I guess that was a sort of symbolism to show the gap between us on the scale of things at the time. I was still relatively un concerned with knowing a lot of people at school, most of the people who were aware of me were just that, aware of me. Whether it was through my more popular friends, elementary school classes, or my sudden appearance during middle school. You didn’t know me though. And I didn’t know you in the slightest. When I was moved to the front into the seat across from you I first heard your voice, it felt as if in the back I couldn’t hear a word you were saying. But here. Front and center, though I didn’t know your face I knew your voice first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were loud, funny even. I could tell what type of person you were but I didn’t immediately turn away, I was curious. And that might’ve been the start of my downfall. Curiosity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A week later I had new glasses, they were black and rectangular and ugly. I was still in the hopes of transferring out of that class but I’d developed a connection to our meek teacher. I’d also grown a fascination towards you, often thinking about how I’d miss your jokes if I left. So I told my counselor I was fine where I was. I’d also attached a face to a voice by now. You were dark and your confidence was alluring, for I had not so easily ever had to look someone like you in the face for so long. It was fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were polar opposites, you dressed well and held yourself like you were on top of the world. I had not acquired a fashion sense yet and I shamefully walked the halls, praying nobody saw me. I was a sad person really, I had just learned simple styles to do my hair with and it didn’t help that I&amp;#39;d spent the entirety of summer in a house with nobody but my family. I wanted out, an escape. You felt forbidden almost, and I was being tempted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I pitied our teacher and made an effort to answer most of the questions as everyone else turned her out or learned in silence. I knew one other person in the class who sometimes helped her out, he was also a close friend of yours and an old classmate of mine. (let&amp;#39;s call him Bob) Bob was chill for the most part, he was on the football team with you but acted totally different from the rest of the players. Sure he’d joke around but I’d never heard Bob being as disgusting as his mates. But I also didn’t know him, we had math together in seventh grade but that was about it, never exchanged any words really and he openly let me know that back then he was convinced I was special ed…. Bob tried in class and he had the second highest grade in her class, after me of course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was your second time in this class, our teacher made that known with the familiarity she held with you. I almost felt bad but i’d seen your type a million times before, it was nothing new. So why did I feel so bad about it? It had been only eleven day of school before I asked Bob for your number. I should’ve never done it. Never. But I did and I got your snap. We talked there for a couple hours before exchanging numbers and texting through imessage. You were bold, I do not have these messages anymore but I do remember that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it clear I wasn’t as nerdy as I seemed in our shared class but looking back on myself at that point in life it was a lie. You wanted “things” from me and I was too far into the first stage of my fast and hard addiction towards you. I flirted back, entertained the idea swearing up and down it&amp;#39;ll never happen. I was sure of it. Positive even. The texts between messages and snap went on for awhile, I started helping you out in class, obsessing over my hair and lack of good clothing. I told my friends about you to a certain extent leaving out that fact that I had you as a saved contact. When I asked you about yourself I didn’t like the response. I found it boring and it matched the way to present yourself exactly. What kept me hooked was the way you countered yourself constantly, sure the obscene gestures you’d present in class were nothing but immature and vile but I thought it was funny me being the same way secretly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the day our teacher trusted you with a new seat, the one directly beside me. I panicked going up to her after class. She knew I liked you. I know she did. She then asked me something I’d never given a thought to before. “Are you sure you can handle sitting by him?” she said she’d sat you beside me because she knew I could deal with your personality, with fear of her moving you without missing a beat I said yes. I wanted you there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next bit of this is gross. I can’t ever think about this day without almost bringing myself to tears, it was the day I changed a lot as a person. September 10th. You kept hinting at it during class, I was a little scared to shut you down, I wanted you to continue acknowledging me. Looking back I should&amp;#39;ve asked to changed seats immediately. There was no advice in the world that would’ve gotten me to do it though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said yes and as soon as the bell rang you got up urging me to follow you. I had little to no time to reflect and really think about what I was doing. You were walking so fast I left my friend in the other class trailing behind my speed walk to keep up to you. She asked where I was going, what the hell I was doing. I honestly didn’t know. It was a friday. I know that much, See I’m the type of person to really think about all the possible consequences to my choices before doing them. I knew who you were, I knew what you were too. A literal whore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got to the gym I saw my cousin and my friend staying there, I hesitated “&lt;strong&gt;Are you coming&lt;/strong&gt;?” I continued walking. We got to the place and you stared at me, my mouth went dry and I wanted to cry and leave. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two sides of myself fighting each other one telling me to leave and stop being stupid and the other dangerous side telling me that i’d gone too far to stop now that i couldn’t be a pussy, was I a pussy? I wish I was in that moment, I wish I’d listen to my mind that overthinks to the fullest extreme. “&lt;strong&gt;Are you gonna do it or not?&lt;/strong&gt;” ‘&lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt;’ “&lt;strong&gt;Fuck it&lt;/strong&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few days were spent crying and beating myself up about it. Was this really me? The worst part about it is that I felt bad about my performance and me being the overachiever I am, I learned absolutely nothing good and did it again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More beating myself up. Now the problem was I was hooked on you. I’d never done even so much as kissed anyone and so I developed a fast attachment to you. I am always locating wherever you happen to be in the area. Not to be creepy but to keep myself from wondering. I just liked being aware. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I continued to help you in class but you quickly made my life hell only it didn’t quite reach me. “Friday” that asshat nickname. I knew who was aware of what happened and who wasn’t. Yet I didn’t care because I only really gave a rat’s ass about what you thought. Sure I hated it and cried about it, but it didn’t really matter considering it never left the classroom. I still continued to go to your games and help you with work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping towards november we were working on a project together and I went on my phone. I remember hearing the back and forth but I didn’t realize who it was between at the time brushing it off as you and Bob going at it at one another. It wasn’t Bob. When you stood up, I instantly noticed the cold air that hit my shoulder. I looked up and my heart sunk. Though we talked you into sitting down the second you turned away he hit you, that was the end of that. You swung on him and beat him into the ground, he was a pretty big dude, bigger than Bob. He fell hard; my desk sliding across the room with me in it. I jumped up and eventually removed myself from the situation. This was bad. With all the fights that had happened, expulsion was a likely scenario considering your cousin has jumped in to help. I knew this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You weren&amp;#39;t at school the next day but it was all anyone was talking about. I texted you in a bit of a panic checking up and all that. Our teacher expressed how she was going to try her best to save you in her statement but I knew that might not be enough, it was out of her job description. I often forget this bit but I wanted to share it anyway. I remember reading the report she wrote and cringing at the bits that could possibly be used against you. I couldn’t with good conscience turn this into your administrator and hope for the best. So I went upstairs and explained the situation to a trusted teacher who often helped me get away with things. He helped me edit and reprint her statement to make you look better. I then delivered it to your administrator, our now principal. This part is grosser than anything else I’ve said leading up to this point. I remember asking her how it was looking, she couldn’t go into details. I was not kin nore your girlfriend or whatever. I introduced myself as someone who was just concerned with no ill intent. I wasn’t happy with the answer I got but I knew that statement was enough to get you off the hook even a little bit. I could never tell you this, it seems obsessive and weird. I kind of am though if you couldn&amp;#39;t tell from the get go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sum it up you were expelled to the other school for 45 days. That was way less than everyone else was getting so I was happy. What didn’t help was our teacher bringing it up every single day and then proceeding to drag me into the conversation. We spoke while you were out maybe once or twice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attempted to unattach myself from you during this time as well. I knew your type very well. I had a few failed talking stages, most of them being ruined by your friends bringing what I did with you up to them or me subconsciously comparing them to you and completely losing attraction if I thought for a second you’d just laugh at them. I needed someone you more or less respected. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around this time I’d also taken a bigger liking towards drugs, often showing up to school and work high off my ass. It was nice, but I also didn’t get much school work done. It was pretty bad. I was sad, everything in the months prior distracted me from myself and being left alone with these thoughts in my addict ass subspace wasn’t a good mix. I tried to get out of it but it was just so comforting. The dropping of my grades was enough to put stress and anger into the mix. I was not making smart choices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I eventually shut down and ended up in the emergency room. I spent the majority of that time crying and thinking about how weirded out you would be if you knew. I also plotted on killing myself the first three days. I could do nothing but sit there, eat, sleep, and read the same book over and over again. I did just that, mostly sleeping and sometimes being able to color. That place was really fucking weird and all I wanted to do was leave. I didn’t deserve to be there, it was literal hell. This is around the time you came back to school. I knew it was your return week and I was in the hospital for the entirety of it. When I got out I saw you in the commons at school and any attempt to forget you was tossed out the window. The second day I saw you, you happened to also see me “&lt;strong&gt;I know that’s not _____&lt;/strong&gt;.” I said Hey. That was a mistake as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not the same person I was when we first met. I believed you were on top of the world. The most important person in the room. You had big things waiting for you and everyone in our school knew it. You were somebody and the world didn’t know it yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had moved to a new area the day I was released. My dog had also given up whilst I was gone. I didn&amp;#39;t feel much as things were moving very quickly and I didn’t have much time to process. It just so happens that you live a few minutes away from me, a minute drive at most, maybe a 10-15 minute walk if you’re a slow walker. This was bad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rode the same bus now. At the time I was so happy about it even though I never said it outloud. We had different classes but I still had to see you on the daily, it wasn’t long before you realized what a score it was for you and eventually you showed up at my house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d told you I was a virgin before but you didn’t care enough to remember so when you asked on this day I lied. I didn’t cry, I didn’t want you to know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must&amp;#39;ve done something right because that day turned into once a week which turned into whenever you didn’t have a game or practice. It bled into the summer and you were over often. Me and my friend, the same one who all those months ago all but ran behind me to stop me from following you helped me take the car and you and him and would come over, a “two man” I guess or whatever. It was fun, we smoked, we drove around. We never really went anywhere but I still wasn’t too into parties or any of that shit so it didn’t really matter to me. I was addicted to every part of you and the summer was a haze. I cried and screamed. I pleaded with myself to stop. I knew nothing good would come out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That must&amp;#39;ve been the same side of me that told me to walk away back on September 10th. I tried. Fuck. You know I tried, I told you the truth, I cried to my friends about it, I cried to my grandma about it. Yet I just didn’t know when to quit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before school ended I saw you walking with her, I was in front of yall and heard the entirety of the conversation. I was pissed for the most part. But I all but prayed it didn’t go anywhere. We weren’t anywhere close to being something. I was stupid to hope because now I see you two everywhere. In the process of straightening my schedule out I ended up with the same lunch and now I sit with people I couldn’t give less of a fuck about as our friendship ran dry years prior and the punishment for doing stupid shit being to watch you talk and walk with her as I sit there in pain while I&amp;#39;m burdened with trying to figure the fuck out how to abort this baby before it’s too late. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh I know you remember recent events well. I told you and you looked at me stupid. Accused me of being with other people- well you were not entirely wrong but one of those “people” was a girl and the other I did no more than make out with. So that shit really hurt.

I’m on track to graduating with an associates degree with still little regard for my mental health and you are quite literally one of the best on our football team. &lt;/p&gt;

"Hello all,

I hope I found the correct subreddit for this. If this isn't the right place, I apologize. You fine people have a good day and I will excuse myself. 

I have recently found myself in some kind of relationship with an enchanting woman and she has recently communicated that she is expecting some love letter type correspondence soon with period materials because she found out that I used to do calligraphy more frequently and experiment with making my own paper and ink from a few different time periods. I have different wax seals and colored wax and ribbons and stuff like that too.

I am comfortable with spencerian/copperplate type Victorian stuff and German Blackletter type Medieval Gothic styles. 

I think I have some good starter ideas for the kinds of things that she will appreciate (music and cat based marginalia sprinkled with some profanity illumination) but I am open to ideas. It has been interesting to see what other people have come up with so far.

If anyone has any suggestions or good resources to point me towards, I would greatly appreciate it.

There are a lot of possibilities here but I don't know where to start. 😂

Is there a good protocol for starting these kinds of things as to not get too heavy too fast?

" *Okay...* hello \[redacted\],  


I know I shouldn't do this. That first email I sent you is probably the one thing I regret the most this year, but somehow I find myself here again, feeling the need to bare my soul to you. I'm not sure why, but I'll try to explain it shortly. I've been thinking about you a lot since then, wondering why you didn't reply to the last email. Did you lose all interest once I revealed who I was? Did you find it weird that it came from someone who you've never spoken to? Did you just not remember who I was? Were you going to reply and then something else came up and you forgot to? Or did I make out that last email too much as if it was all a mistake and I didn't care if you replied or not? Admittedly, I really wanted you to, even if it would be a harsh or dismissive response. During that time though, I came up with more things I feel like I have to say to you, and my mind won't let me rest until I say it. So, this email is me saying ""*fuck it*"". It can't get any worse. I've already embarrassed myself by sending you two, so what's one more for my peace of mind?  


Firstly though, I feel like I have to try and explain myself here (*the first email, and whatever the hell it is I'm doing here again*). I have a mental disorder. No, this isn't like when teenage girls get on Twitter, Tik Tok, or *whatever* social media, and claim they're ""*bi-polar*"" just because they have a few mood swings. I'm diagnosed with an obsessive-compulsive related disorder. I don't want to get into specifics because it is embarrassing... but yea, I basically have OCD. It's hard to explain with words, but in regards to what I'm doing here, it's like... I have these uncontrollable thoughts, sometimes fantasies, sometimes ideas, and it's like... if I don't execute these ideas, then I constantly contemplate obsessively over them for long periods of time. It's not like what I want to do is ever immoral or disingenuous, and it doesn't make my thoughts and feelings any less genuine and sincere, but the issue is, whatever it is I'm thinking of doing, I get fixated on the results that I want, instead of the results that I'm realistically likely to get. For instance, this situation, I know you don't want a *long ass* email from a madman you barely knew in high school rambling on about nonsense, but after wrestling with my mind I decide to send it anyway, because of that 0.0001% chance that you'll see it and reply heartfully, even though it's weird. My mind has been getting lost daily in a fantasy where this whole thing goes exactly the way I want it to, with us becoming pen pals who write 1-2 emails to each other every year or 2, updating one another on the milestones and setbacks in our lives and such. I know it may sound confusing, but it's frustratingly complicated, and to reiterate, difficult for me to explain with words.  


I'm also compelled to do this from the fact that I'm never going to see you in person again. To be honest, I take comfort in that fact. But as impulsive and impetuous the decision to write and send you that first email was, I wouldn't have just randomly sent that to just anyone (*well at least I don't think so*). You were my first high school crush. You should already know that. In fact you were probably a lot of people's first '*high school crush*' from our year. I still remember that time at the beginning of summer classes when I walked into that classroom and saw your face for the first time. I was smitten! And you know, I'm from the depths of South Manchester, I'd never seen anyone like you before at that point. You know in those high school movies when a character sees their crush for the first time and everything is suddenly moving in slow motion? That was me! You were like... a star! Not as in ""superstar"", but like the sun. It was like you were the source of light for that entire room, the entire school even.  


When the actual school year started, I remember being so fucking ecstatic that you were in my class. I remember staring at you constantly for a while there during the 1st year. I had actually convinced myself that I was going to pluck up the courage to talk to you, and that you had already liked me, and that we were going to be secret lovers (*LO-FUCKING-L*). I'm not sure if that was my mental illness on silent display, or just my narcissism at the time (*I'm willing to bet the latter*), but luckily I didn't have the confidence to say anything to you. Asking you ""what time is it?"" was all I could manage, but whatever little confidence I had at that point was snuffed out after I let my made up misguiding fantasies lead me into telling \[redacted\] and \[redacted\] (*idk if you'll remember them*) that you liked me (*because of course you noticing me staring you the fuck down meant that you liked me back lol*), to which they both proceeded to laugh in my face upon hearing my absurd claim.  


I think they told you about it, I'm not sure because I wasn't there, they just said they would. I was crushed, but it was a much needed wake-up call. I was immature, I was an idiot, I was annoying, I was arrogant, I was a narcissist... maybe I still am. I actually learned a lot from that situation. Though at the time, none of the things I just said about myself, I became self-aware of all that much later in life unfortunately. But back then, I learned a bit about 'classes' and 'leagues' (*as you were way out of mine*), and a bit about my social status being a poor ugly kid with buck teeth and a lisp, in a school with a lot of pretty rich kids with pretty rich parents (*emphasis on ""a bit"" there*).    


Soon after that though... nothing. I surprisingly '*got over it*' quite quickly. Looking back at it now, it feels strange for me to go from being that obsessed with someone and thinking about them all the time, to not caring about them at all or even acknowledging their presence. I mean, you were around for the 4 years I was at that school, and sometime after I even found your Instagram page with the tacky username (*I hope you have a separate work email by the way lol*), but those feelings weren't evoked until that night I started reminiscing about high school days. It makes me wonder, do we actually willingly '*get over*' our infatuations, or do we just bury them all deep deep inside with the likeliness they'll remerge if we ever look at, talk to, be around, or even think about that person for too long? Or..... maybe it's just my OCD. I've just recently started to cope with my mental issues.  


I still barely know anything about you and what you've been up to nowadays though, so I thought it would be fun to guess. I imagine you're some kind of business woman. Sales representative or accountant maybe... but not small time, for a big corporation where you will steadily '*climb the ladder*'. I imagine you're the type of girl that plans out their life and has it play out exactly or pretty close to how they wanted it to, because you're dedicated and willing to put in the work to make it so. I imagine you're not married yet, but have an obedient long term boyfriend who knows you well enough to propose at the perfect time. I imagine you're still sociable, and balance your work-life by having weekend nights out with friends to bars, festivals, movies etc., with maybe the one or two one-night-stands here and there (*just to test the waters lol*) because you're the prize in your relationship, not him! I imagine you don't have kids yet either. How old are you now, 26? I imagine you'll be married by 28 and have your first child by 32. And I imagine by then you'll have life sorted out; mortgage paid, your child's college tuition set aside, multiple investments, and you'll feel financially stable enough to take island vacation trips with your family twice a year. But I have no idea if any of that is true or will be, that's just the fantasy version of you that I have in my head. The reality is, I have no idea who you are. For some reason, that makes me sad.  


As for me (*if you're even the least bit interested*), I was catching up with Daniel Dixon on Instagram the other day and I told him my life has been ""depressingly sad"". Unfortunately, that was me being honest to him. I've been considering writing a book about it... no, like seriously, I've actually been considering it. I guess I'd have to learn how to actually *write* first though. But what does it matter anyway, I feel like I will climb to the top of this roof and jump off of it before I even write a single word.  


Love. Always.  
\[redacted\]",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-08-26T22:19:14.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay...&lt;/em&gt; hello [redacted],  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t do this. That first email I sent you is probably the one thing I regret the most this year, but somehow I find myself here again, feeling the need to bare my soul to you. I&amp;#39;m not sure why, but I&amp;#39;ll try to explain it shortly. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about you a lot since then, wondering why you didn&amp;#39;t reply to the last email. Did you lose all interest once I revealed who I was? Did you find it weird that it came from someone who you&amp;#39;ve never spoken to? Did you just not remember who I was? Were you going to reply and then something else came up and you forgot to? Or did I make out that last email too much as if it was all a mistake and I didn&amp;#39;t care if you replied or not? Admittedly, I really wanted you to, even if it would be a harsh or dismissive response. During that time though, I came up with more things I feel like I have to say to you, and my mind won&amp;#39;t let me rest until I say it. So, this email is me saying &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;fuck it&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;. It can&amp;#39;t get any worse. I&amp;#39;ve already embarrassed myself by sending you two, so what&amp;#39;s one more for my peace of mind?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly though, I feel like I have to try and explain myself here (&lt;em&gt;the first email, and whatever the hell it is I&amp;#39;m doing here again&lt;/em&gt;). I have a mental disorder. No, this isn&amp;#39;t like when teenage girls get on Twitter, Tik Tok, or &lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt; social media, and claim they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;bi-polar&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; just because they have a few mood swings. I&amp;#39;m diagnosed with an obsessive-compulsive related disorder. I don&amp;#39;t want to get into specifics because it is embarrassing... but yea, I basically have OCD. It&amp;#39;s hard to explain with words, but in regards to what I&amp;#39;m doing here, it&amp;#39;s like... I have these uncontrollable thoughts, sometimes fantasies, sometimes ideas, and it&amp;#39;s like... if I don&amp;#39;t execute these ideas, then I constantly contemplate obsessively over them for long periods of time. It&amp;#39;s not like what I want to do is ever immoral or disingenuous, and it doesn&amp;#39;t make my thoughts and feelings any less genuine and sincere, but the issue is, whatever it is I&amp;#39;m thinking of doing, I get fixated on the results that I want, instead of the results that I&amp;#39;m realistically likely to get. For instance, this situation, I know you don&amp;#39;t want a &lt;em&gt;long ass&lt;/em&gt; email from a madman you barely knew in high school rambling on about nonsense, but after wrestling with my mind I decide to send it anyway, because of that 0.0001% chance that you&amp;#39;ll see it and reply heartfully, even though it&amp;#39;s weird. My mind has been getting lost daily in a fantasy where this whole thing goes exactly the way I want it to, with us becoming pen pals who write 1-2 emails to each other every year or 2, updating one another on the milestones and setbacks in our lives and such. I know it may sound confusing, but it&amp;#39;s frustratingly complicated, and to reiterate, difficult for me to explain with words.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m also compelled to do this from the fact that I&amp;#39;m never going to see you in person again. To be honest, I take comfort in that fact. But as impulsive and impetuous the decision to write and send you that first email was, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have just randomly sent that to just anyone (&lt;em&gt;well at least I don&amp;#39;t think so&lt;/em&gt;). You were my first high school crush. You should already know that. In fact you were probably a lot of people&amp;#39;s first &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;high school crush&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39; from our year. I still remember that time at the beginning of summer classes when I walked into that classroom and saw your face for the first time. I was smitten! And you know, I&amp;#39;m from the depths of South Manchester, I&amp;#39;d never seen anyone like you before at that point. You know in those high school movies when a character sees their crush for the first time and everything is suddenly moving in slow motion? That was me! You were like... a star! Not as in &amp;quot;superstar&amp;quot;, but like the sun. It was like you were the source of light for that entire room, the entire school even.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the actual school year started, I remember being so fucking ecstatic that you were in my class. I remember staring at you constantly for a while there during the 1st year. I had actually convinced myself that I was going to pluck up the courage to talk to you, and that you had already liked me, and that we were going to be secret lovers (&lt;em&gt;LO-FUCKING-L&lt;/em&gt;).

I was never really a go-getter. I'd dream, but there wasn't much follow through because I was always unsure of myself. 

But with you it's so, very clear to me. 

I want to be with you. I want to kiss you. I want to take care of you. I want to tell you about my day. I want a future with you. 

You make me want to do things I've never done before, and you're the first person I've ever properly confessed to. When it comes to you there's no logic, no reasoning, no rationale. Just pure, raw emotion. 

I love the way your eyes smile with your lips. I love listening to your stories. I love the way you play with my hair. I love the way we fit together as we hold one another.

"The ignoring and the jealousy is too much.

Seeing you online on WhatsApp all the time, but leaving me unread just tells me other guys are pining after you and you're loving it.

Your Twitter platform is too much for me. That isn't a criticism, I know my jealousy isn't your problem and your Twitter is something that brings you joy and happiness. But I personally cannot and could not cope with that.

You blocked me because I told you an ex reached out and asked to meet up. I told you that as a friend, not a brag or a tease. I never even said I was meeting her. You immediately assumed. But you've told me countless times about guys DMing you and the dates you go on. Even this guitar guy writing you songs and asking you on dates. Constantly posting thirsty shit and asking strangers to contact you in any way. I tell you about an ex and boom I'm a cunt. It's extremely hypocritical. Apparently putting you third when you were first the entire time. You put yourself beyond last. Over literally nothing.

Despite knowing I'm extremely jealous you still would ask strangers to reach out, you knew exactly what it would do to me and did it anyway. That's not what a friend would do.

In addition to that, you tell me you're falling for me, yet are still asking for every man and his dog to contact you. You know it would all be thirsty men replying to you. Do you actually know what it is to ""fall"" for someone? I don't think you do.

You played me really well, I won't deny that. You certainly know your way around a man's brain and know how to hook them. I fell for every single bit like an idiot so it's my own fault. Going by your platform and dating history you've learned it pretty well.
You can pretend you're just innocently looking for friends but you know you enjoyed getting me into you. Was it fun for you to turn someone's head that was meant to be on a break? 

You won't admit that, you won't even realise that, but it's the truth.

That night I bombarded your WhatsApp (I'll admit I was pretty crazy, I had had a lot to drink but it isn't an excuse so I apologise) you said, and I quote, ""Can we please talk about this in the morning. Like normal human beings please? I don't want us to fall out. Because surprisingly you mean a lot to me.""
I then asked you to explain 'last night', very rationally, and you played dumb. Kept me blocked. And basically told me to fuck off with your final message.

All it tells me is you weren't a friend at all. You certainly don't respect me. And you absolutely did not have feelings for me, let alone falling for me.
Again, my own fault for falling for your bullshit but shame on you for saying things I wanted, maybe even needed, to hear when you knew I was at a low point. You can't convince me otherwise.

It will probably bring you joy and I'll hate myself for saying this. But if there is goodness in you, you have seriously hurt and embarrassed me.

You can feel good about yourself by telling people they can reach out to you but you should feel bad for how you've made me feel. I reached out to you to see if you were okay. And you've made me feel this way for absolutely fucking nothing. Really think about it. It was for nothing. Don't tell someone you like them when you're chasing for their friends. Don't tell someone you're there for them then ignore and block them. Don't tell someone you're falling for them then intentionally trigger the two things you know they hate the most. Don't tell someone you'll talk about it the next day then pretend it didn't happen.

You said a bunch of shit then hid. Texting me the same night asking to be friends and not to fall out. Messaging the following morning asking if we're still friends then ignoring the fact you said you'd talk about it the next day. I was having a god damn breakdown and it's nothing to you.

A friend? Fuck that and fuck you too.

If you actually gave a fuck about me you would have made the smallest attempt to resolve it. But you hid behind blocks and began searching the next guy.
You can keep this message as a trophy for one of the biggest bites you've ever had.

Oh well, onto the next guy.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-08-22T20:37:44.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ignoring and the jealousy is too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing you online on WhatsApp all the time, but leaving me unread just tells me other guys are pining after you and you&amp;#39;re loving it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Twitter platform is too much for me. That isn&amp;#39;t a criticism, I know my jealousy isn&amp;#39;t your problem and your Twitter is something that brings you joy and happiness. But I personally cannot and could not cope with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You blocked me because I told you an ex reached out and asked to meet up. I told you that as a friend, not a brag or a tease. I never even said I was meeting her. You immediately assumed. But you&amp;#39;ve told me countless times about guys DMing you and the dates you go on. Even this guitar guy writing you songs and asking you on dates. Constantly posting thirsty shit and asking strangers to contact you in any way. I tell you about an ex and boom I&amp;#39;m a cunt. It&amp;#39;s extremely hypocritical. Apparently putting you third when you were first the entire time. You put yourself beyond last. Over literally nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite knowing I&amp;#39;m extremely jealous you still would ask strangers to reach out, you knew exactly what it would do to me and did it anyway. That&amp;#39;s not what a friend would do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, you tell me you&amp;#39;re falling for me, yet are still asking for every man and his dog to contact you. You know it would all be thirsty men replying to you. Do you actually know what it is to &amp;quot;fall&amp;quot; for someone? I don&amp;#39;t think you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You played me really well, I won&amp;#39;t deny that. You certainly know your way around a man&amp;#39;s brain and know how to hook them. I fell for every single bit like an idiot so it&amp;#39;s my own fault. Going by your platform and dating history you&amp;#39;ve learned it pretty well.
You can pretend you&amp;#39;re just innocently looking for friends but you know you enjoyed getting me into you. Was it fun for you to turn someone&amp;#39;s head that was meant to be on a break? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;#39;t admit that, you won&amp;#39;t even realise that, but it&amp;#39;s the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That night I bombarded your WhatsApp (I&amp;#39;ll admit I was pretty crazy, I had had a lot to drink but it isn&amp;#39;t an excuse so I apologise) you said, and I quote, &amp;quot;Can we please talk about this in the morning. Like normal human beings please? I don&amp;#39;t want us to fall out. Because surprisingly you mean a lot to me.&amp;quot;

"As much as I want to hold, love and treasure you
You're nothing but ash to me.

My bones are melting when I'm with you 
You make me feel weak, hated, unwanted or even annoying by just asking how you are 

The golden moments fade into cold reality of what actually happened than I made myself believe the lies I made up to fill the emptiness of what I hoped you fill. 

I can't do anything right in your eyes. Doesn't matter if it was grades, cleaning my room not the way you wanted, making friends, finding myself, being who I am or more what you expected me to be. 

The fog is getting thicker, my eyes close and I Imagen myself within the story I made up with parents I adore to come home to. 

Words you speak cut deeper than the knife I'd rather had in my body than your comments in my mind constantly hurting me over and over again 

You never stopped. You laugh about me, snicker and whisper like a highschool kid bully. 

Water run cold of the ocean even tho I was never afraid to swim and try it. I will drown in the never ending blue of you. 

Love I felt for you as your child has faded and even after the feeling of betrayal I still stick to you and would say I love you. Even tho. I don't want to. 

Pictures of the past are neverless and irrelevant
Nothing what you did can be forgiven

Not in my eyes. I'd lie to you and reassure you I'm okay, I have forgiven and forgotten
But deep down 
Deep deep down behind the doors of my heart I forbid myself to go to and reopen I don't forgive you for anything

 Both of you where 

I don't even know what Im saying
All I know that you hate me inside of you. You deep inside of you never wanted me here. 
 Later sure you loved me like your own life but Caring for me as an young life yourself was never the way to be

Why do we have a 4 year gap

Please explain to me…

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to hear your voice in the moment

I absolutely know that I sound obsessive about you

&amp;#x200B;

But you make it so hard for me

Why would you tell me that “If I had your age you would have a massive crush on me”

&amp;#x200B;

What is that supposed to mean

Is it you telling me that you love me

But that our age gap changes everything

I really meant it when i answered that I felt the same way

&amp;#x200B;

The girl that looks exactly like me…

Did you ever hit on her because she looked like me?

&amp;#x200B;

I never believed in online love

Because I think that you need to meet the person your talking to

&amp;#x200B;

That’s the exact reason why I want to meet you

But at the same time I really don’t want to meet you 

Il’l just get hurt more and more

Because WE JUST CAN’T BE TOGETHER

&amp;#x200B;

My heart can’t understand this tho 

Even tho you hurted me so much

My body is still waiting for you

&amp;#x200B;

Love is a choice, a phrase often used by those who’ve never truly been in love. See love is more than the dictionary definition of quote “an intense feeling of deep affection.” Love is the subtle looks you gave her when you were 9 when you first met her because to you, she was the most gorgeous girl in the world, but you were just too shy to say anything, so you go years being her best friend helping through breakup after breakup being the person that she can talk to and stick by her side when no one else will. Until the last time it happens, the last time you can bare to see her get hurt so you comfort her, make her feel better about herself and then slowly grow closer, closer than the two of you have ever been before, until you can't bare the weight on your shoulder of the secrete you’ve kept from her for almost 8 years, so you pour your heart out into a handwritten letter. 4 pages of raw emotion and feelings with tears staining the pages as you wrote but you didn’t care because finally, you’d let her in, into the world of the love that you’ve been building up for almost a decade. You drop the letter off in her letter box, get home and tell her about it, silence, silence for an hour. She sends you a message back saying how blind she was, but she tells you she doesn’t want anything, she is still heartbroken from the previous relationship you helped her get over. You say you understand, but in reality, you’re hurt you’ve been loving her for so long from a distance and you messed up your one chance to get closer……

But she does invite you over the next Saturday morning because she has some free time, the two of you have fun and end up sharing your first kiss on her kitchen floor after cooking dinner, the kiss is the most passionate yet most innocent you have felt in your life, she feels in your arms better than you ever could have imagined and for the next two weeks she was yours, the time spent with her felt like the two of you had been like this for years, those two weeks were genuinely the best in your life. But she has to leave, she has to go 9659km away for 3 months, it hurts but you wait for her, you will because she is the girl you’ve dreamt of since you first met her when you were 9. And you would do anything for her. That is love, and it’s not a choice like picking your favorite ice cream, sometimes you have no choice but to love someone because in your eyes they are too perfect to not fall in love with.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-08-03T19:18:05.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;background: this is a piece I wrote a while back for a school writing assignment and I was looking to see what others thought of it.

&lt;p&gt;But she does invite you over the next Saturday morning because she has some free time, the two of you have fun and end up sharing your first kiss on her kitchen floor after cooking dinner, the kiss is the most passionate yet most innocent you have felt in your life, she feels in your arms better than you ever could have imagined and for the next two weeks she was yours, the time spent with her felt like the two of you had been like this for years, those two weeks were genuinely the best in your life. But she has to leave, she has to go 9659km away for 3 months, it hurts but you wait for her, you will because she is the girl you’ve dreamt of since you first met her when you were 9. And you would do anything for her. That is love, and it’s not a choice like picking your favorite ice cream, sometimes you have no choice but to love someone because in your eyes they are too perfect to not fall in love with.&lt;/p&gt;

"My darling,

It's been 12 whole weeks since I last saw a text from you. It still feels like our goodbye was just a moment ago. So much has happened since then but it still feels like I'm frozen in time. 

These last 3 months have been a war in my head. I'm constantly trying to figure out what it means to move on. Trying to figure out what my life looks like without you. It's without any doubt the hardest thing I've ever had to do. And I'm saying that after I got my platinum trophy on Cuphead.

I have nothing new to say you. I still miss you, I still want you, and I'm still deeply in love with you. I can't believe how right you were. These feelings might never fade away. You told me you'd freeze them and keep them with you. But mine are still wild and walking around my head all night long.

Maybe I'll cave in soon and message you. I want to know that you're happy and that you have moved on. Maybe that will help me get past this too. Until then I'm going to cling on to every ounce of hope that I will see you again. 

Or maybe I won't. Maybe I'll just keep proving to you (and to me) that I am strong enough to be okay with or without you. Until then, I'll keep writing these letters to the ghost of you. Throw in a stupid little poem once in a while; And just hope that you are happy and safe.

"I have always loved you with my whole heart. 

I always thought it would be you and I. 

I never imagined my life without you. 

My heart will always belong to you. 

I gave it willingly and I don't want it back. 

I know how you feel. 

Your eyes I can read.

I have given up. 

Only because you left me no choice. 

I won't make you stay any longer than you must.

I'll be strong and I'll be OK, I promise. 

You have given me more time than I deserved. 

You know what I mean. 

Times coming so fast and I won't lie, I'm terrified. 

Half my life with one person and believed in a fantasy. 

Jokes on me ,right?

You know I wear my heart on my sleeve and I love hard.

Don't confuse my emotions and broken heart for your freedom. 

Look the other way. When you get weak Remember all the bad memories I gave you and keep walking away. K

We both know it will only get worse if we stay.

Eventually  my face will disappear from your mind. 

My voice will start to fade away and then you will forget. 

If only we could have had a chance but we both missed it.

These words are the most difficult and heartbreaking ones that must be said.

I'm hanging on to a thread and you haven't even noticed. 

If you are here and you do read my words,  

Read these,

I love you and I'm hurting. I'm lost because the light in my lighthouse has gone off. I'm drawing in the ocean of all the pain you have given me. The waves are knocking me down constantly, your hateful behavior and selfish ways .

Your constantly trying to up me one. I'm constantly behind you correcting bad discussions and behavior. 
I'm not trying to be in control.  I'm trying to make you understand what you have done was wrong. 
I never signed up to take your mom's place.
But at times I feel like you have thrown me in those shoes. 

I wanted to grow old with you and start a new journey together.

But that wasn't in our cards. 

If I'm wrong speak up and fight with me and NOT against me ever again. That would be asking for a miracle, right?
What was I thinking? 

At all cost remember?? 
But at what cost was my heart worth? 

Frozen in time once again you put our love on the shelf, 
in the end.

I'm not any better than you if I sound like I'm placing blame.  I'm half at fault and if I could have a do over I'd change my ways. 

I'd promise to never let go. I'd fight harder for us. 
I'm sorry I failed. 

But you aren't here so you will never know how I truly loved you and wanted only you.

Your wife.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-07-25T04:04:16.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have always loved you with my whole heart. &lt;/p&gt;

"Dear


I have to be honest with you, I think about you alot.


Every time I see you, my heart skips a beat. 


Seeing your smile has become the best part of my day.


I get butterflies when I see you. It brings me joy that I have not felt ever.


I want to know your world.


I want to know what makes you happy, and lift you up when you are down.


How does a sunset looks on your face?


I know I am married. It was broken long ago. My feelings for you are not the cause of the break.


You're the first person that has made me feel something in so long that I didn't know what it was at first.

I am afraid of doing something wrong and not having you around, but I think it is worth the risk writing you this letter and asking you to take a chance on me.

Yours,

"           Thankyou.

Thank you to the broken , blind and hurting people,
The ones that saw something they could not comprehend , that lashed out seeking to teach only hurt and pain ,where once there was only innocence and trust.
For it is the the way of those,too seek,too mould and remake ,too try and see some reflection of their own unjust learnings of life ,thus  regaining the fools gold version of power never truly perceiving the loss inflicted upon themselves, a debt only ever realised too late.
These are the people who took from you, stole what should have been your child years, years of learning, of wonder, joy and discovery.
Years that were not to be.
Never the less, these are the very same people that steered your course,set you on a perilous ,dark ,painful and difficult journey of self discovery and awareness that was to be repeated in many forms and many lessons.
There was no need for- nor any particular thing that marked you as different, deserving of such cruelty ,unkindness and soul squashing attention, but taught from so young , how could you know or conceive anything different?
I ,in a selfish and perverse way, thank these sad and disillusioned creatures..for without said monsters circling you throughout your life tormenting and twisting your perception of self worth, tugging upon the puppet strings of your anxiety, whispering affirmations of self doubt into your programmed web of beliefs that somehow this was who u were, what you deserved all wrapped neat in a gift box of your own doing.
These are the hollow images of true people , casting no shadows.. no light shone upon them,framing substance throwing silhouettes along the ground…as would you and I , yet these are the people i thank, for if not for all the hardships and unfairness, unkind manipulative cruel lessons … I would not be able to say how proud I am to be with the most beautiful ,strong , challenging, intelligent courageous,passionate, vibrant woman,mother,teacher and lover that i could have dared to dream for.
So yes i thank them, but above all know i have a truly deep respect for who and how, you became all that you are and always were and now walk right beside me.

"July 10, 2019

It was a spotty thunderclouded afternoon on southbound I-15 in Utah - just below the terminal 70 and north of George where the Rockies relax into green spotted hills. I was on the road for work in LA. We moved the family to Colorado before Independence Day and COVID had not yet turned the world into a hive of remote worker bees. I was on my beleaguered way to another shoot day in Santa Clarita. Well, two if we’re being specific. Ricocheting back from the Western Rocky slope, the clouds brooded over the sky in bruises of grey and purple. Without warning, a massive lightning bolt stabbed at the sky from about a half mile due west. In the flash of the charge, the massive thunder-wake of displaced electrons lifted my scruff in breathlessly weird elation. As my heart caught up, I saw someone familiar in the rearview. I knew the shape of her blue-surrounding-green eyes, the bow of her lips, the frame of her golden curls held back from her forehead by a colorful head band 20 years too young for us both. Her expression broke into that long-familiar smirk as I saw her see me. And then I had to react tp the red flash of big rig brake lights in front of me. Alone and bewildered, I continued south toward Las Vegas.

I'm too old to believe in the silliness of youthful hope. She doesn't exist and has been a part of my imagination since I noticed her through the sunbeams, playing alone in her room forty years ago. I'm tired, lonely and disillusioned but I can't let her go.

It was reaching for me.
Pulling me closer and closer
Fear

You caught me and I smiled. The first real smile in months. Finally something, or rather someone.

&lt;p&gt;Skepticism does not evade me,  and you don&amp;#39;t even care that I&amp;#39;m skeptical. You get it. You understand so well that you expected me to respond this way.  You gently guided me home. I want this to be my home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always wanted a home.&lt;/p&gt;

"Thank you to the universe for making me accept the job outside my comfort zone. I never knew I had the talents I got to display at that job &amp; a chance to meet an amazing human, my now partner. We started as friends where I drove you around the town in my tiny car. I know I am a terrible driver but you never complained. From handling my tantrums to dealing with gossip at office. I have always counted on your advice. I love learning from you, your sense of humor &amp; your passion.

All my life, my three decades on this planet, I have been trying to find my love. I was losing hope but then I found you. Whoever I didn't end up with is because universe wanted me to be with you boo. I love you with all my life and you are my bestest friend. 

Your touch is electric &amp; your smile melts my heart. How are you so kind, compassionate &amp; understanding? I love all of this about you. I have always felt so safe with you from the very beginning. I remember the night we had edibles, you stopped us from getting physical. I love how protective you are about me &amp; how much you care for me. I love arguing with you for the sake of fun but when you kiss me it melts my heart. I have never experienced love so deep only read them in books. Glad I am getting to experience it in this lifetime.

 I feel safe &amp; comforted that I have chosen the right person for me.

07/07/2022

Picture this: it’s late at night in the summer and we’ve got nowhere we have to be in the morning. We’d stayed up till late sprawled in my bed in varying states of undress. We’d done our due amount of sex and kissing – till there was only the talking left and that is what we do: talk the same dialect of nonsense. The lamp is off, we’re bleary-eyed and you’ve complained about my ‘loud blinking’. You turn over and I press my chest against your back. I rest my hand on the groove of your side. 

‘What would you do if I peed in your fridge?’ You mumbled that – or something to the same effect of lunacy and impossibility. ‘I’d suck your dick’ I mutter back – or something to the same effect of dismissal and placation. We go around a couple of times and you go quiet and I assume that you’ve decided that you are done for the night, struggled to think of absurd situations of my own but admitted defeat to my fatigue and then you say: ‘What would you do if I proposed to you?’ and you knock all of the air out of my body. 

Suddenly I was a child again – mouth agape as I look up at my mother, hand buried deep in the peanut butter jar, legs outstretched on the ground. 

My first instinct is the desperate search for a lie but you’d caught me off guard. Or maybe I am incredibly weak and the sound of your voice reduces me to infirmity. You must have felt my heart jumpstart in my chest like an old boat engine. Hand in the jar. Mouth agape. I wonder if I only imagined the strange sincerity in your tone. 

‘I would say yes’ felt like the worst possible thing to say – I might as well have given you my passport and my debit card and my keys and the original copy of my birth cert. Incredulous at myself, I tried to fabricate some scenario in which my reply had been part of an elaborate comedic *bit*. So that I could undo myself.  So that I could undo the big gaudy slice of myself you had inexorably coaxed out of me. 

The truth was that I had been stopping outside of jewellery store windows to stare at wedding rings. The truth was that I spent every moment apart from you trying – against my will, god dammit – to recreate the experience of you. The truth was that you’ve reduced me into this stumbling creature that sings along to love songs and cries at airport chase scenes and covets the scent of your laundry detergent. You’ve made me unproductive, unrealistic, illogical, and incredibly stupid and you occupy all my time and imagination and the thought of you on one knee looking up at me with those big stupid eyes is something so large and dizzying that the very act of materialising it with your voice should register as a crime against humanity.

‘Really?’ was all you managed, and I started, pathetically, to amend my answer and I tell you that I am just at am impulsive stage of my life and implying that it was not, at all, the case that I was desperately and terrifyingly in love with you.  And the more I continued to explain this the more I deflate at the obvious lie and the anticipation of your reaction. It was supposed to be a secret. Remember that you forced it out of me. Remember that and have some mercy. I feel myself sinking, sinking, spinning. 

‘That scares me, honestly,’ you said in response, but you turn back towards me and I look down ‘, I wouldn’t want to jump into a marriage straight away’ ‘Then don’t propose to me.’ I’d meant to say it light-heartedly but it came out pointed, betraying my hurt. I’ve never been good at pretending to be anything and am often disappointed in my inability to appear unaffected. (I am often very deeply affected). ‘You’d get bored, I bet. I bet you’d cheat on me after the first year of marriage.’ You said, wrapping your arms around me. I lean into the warmth of your body. I’ve told you about the deadliness of your voice; here you are building sandcastles out of words. The thought of our marriage – the idea of it – existing in your head. As a premise to a downfall. As a millisecond. 

‘Hmm, maybe I would.’ I said, sighing happily. ‘Well, I’m not proposing to you any time soon so don’t get your hopes up’ and you kiss me on the forehead and that was truly the end of the night. But you never said you wouldn’t, ever. You never said you wouldn’t.

"I know, it’s been 10 years already. It feels like a lifetime ago but also feels like it wasn’t that long. It just feels weird now how time flies.

Yesterday, I watched the live feed of your graduation. I felt so proud of your achievement. I wanted to message you but then I realized, we’re practically strangers now. We haven’t talked well since the break up. It’s really weird how it’s been 10 years already.

Now that you’ve graduated while I’m still in my 2nd year, I can’t help but feel the ‘what ifs’ of us staying together. It could have been nice to work on our dreams together. But, oh well. At this point, I keep with me the good memories. I hope one day in the future we can share our stories. Moving on isn’t really linear but now I kinda feel like the years apart has done us well.

"Dear Julia,

The strongest proof of God of which I’m aware is to be in your presence. There is something about you that is more comfortable than comfort, stronger than strength, and deeper than what I’ve come to expect from ordinary interactions. Like that old scene in The Wizard of Oz, when I’m with you I feel like I’ve been lifted from the Kansas of my youth to a world of magic only to find out, finally, that there is even more to it, some force behind the curtains pulling the levers when for most people there are no curtains or force at all. (Nevermind that in the film it was just an ordinary guy behind the curtains whereas for you it’s kinda the opposite because it’s your faith; I think despite all of that the analogy still more or less works but… I digress).

My favorite thing about you – besides, of course, your relentless quest to extract every giggle from me with your tickling – is that I feel like I could pour into you my every daily story, deep sorrow, awful anxiety, cherished victory, wordle win, nervous skepticism, stupid thought, wishful fantasy, dumb joke, and idle dream, and you still would have room for more. I bet each of your friends would say the same thing. Yet even as you are a bottomless cup to take in the world, you yourself are constantly overflowing. Take it from an introvert like myself: it’s admirable that you’re so regularly compelled to check your experiences with your friends and seek their feedback. “I wanted a male and female perspective on this thing.” I love that about you. For all your sense of direction, you still make sure to stop and check that you’re going the right way.

I want you to know how I feel because at root I agree with you that this “thing” between us isn’t going to and shouldn’t lead to anything more than its current “thing”ness. We both deserve to be with someone long term who shares our family and life values, you especially deserve to be with someone who has worked equally hard in crafting his faith to be a bedrock motivation for all he does in the world. And yet it remains that I’ve come to think very fondly, very lovingly, even, of you, and if we can’t chase our feelings down whatever rabbit hole they’re beckoning us towards, we can at least shine a brighter light on them so that, looking back, we know we weren’t deceived.

I really do have a lot of love “for you”. And to the extent that passionate, honeymoon period-type feelings equate to real feelings, I have no problem saying that I love you. You are a beautiful woman (and a babe to top it off), but more than that you have a beautiful soul, and that’s why I don’t feel too creepy or overbearing in saying such a thing. I think anyone who takes you seriously would come to think of you with a feeling of love. But this is especially important to me because, as I’ve alluded to, I had a nasty breakup in my last relationship and, truth be told, the anger and bitterness I even now still feel from it have been, maybe to the same extend as my work travels, a major source of why I haven’t found a new relationship. So it’s with some major grace – as you might say – that I’ve met someone who I could easily see myself dating and with whom, if things were right, I would risk again falling in love.

But things aren’t right; our parachutes have already been pulled to stop that sort of falling. And in two months I won’t be around nearly as often as I am now. So I don’t think any of this is too, too big of a deal. I would view our “thing” as a success if we could see each other here and there until my lease is up and, from then, if we could cheer each other on with every new turn in life – job changes, moves, and eventually, serious partners. It will be enough for me to know that what we felt was real even if it wasn’t meant to be and to know that you knew how I felt.

In summary, our love is like the planetary status of Pluto: technically yes, but only for a while. It never even made a full rotation around the sun.

Here’s to me be thinkin’ bout chu,

Much love,

Aaron

Aaron,

Your words are very dear to me. I feel overwhelmingly grateful to have such lovely words written about our time together, and I will cherish them. It has taken me a while to come around to the difficult reality that we care enough about one another to let each other go. There is something in me that jumps up to object when I think of never being next to you again, but with time and practice I will be able to look on us only with fondness.

I have felt loved by you and wish I could convey how dear you have become to me in other ways than a manifesto-sequel letter. I would rather show you slowly over many moons of companionship and trips to foreign places and secret exchanges under covers. I am sorry I am not better at offering up my friendship to you in lieu of all these things – from the first time I saw you I felt your magnetic pull and I’m quite certain it’s here to stay.

The more I learned the mind behind those effortlessly weaponized eyes, the less I have been able to control my compounding feelings for you. Your capacity to love and communicate love is uncommonly beautiful, and I hope you know how precious I have counted the moments spent on its receiving end.

Your passion for stretching your mind and pushing your body past its perceived limits is not only admirable, but serves as a projection of the core strength you possess. You sharpen your mind and body as you do your character – and this relentless desire to learn and grow will never allow you to reach a final state of being as so many do. I love this drive in you; the battle against complacency and respect for discomfort are much more than many are willing to submit to for growth. I know it is one of the many special things that will make you an exemplary husband and father. This strength in you can be hard to oppose, so choose your battles wisely with those you love, but never let it dull for anything or anyone.

I do want to take up space to apologize for not caring for you and respecting you in the ways you so deserve. There was always a shadowed gap between how I treated you and how I wanted to treat you. And in that place it was always raining, overcrowded with thoughts and feelings, and altogether a bit chaotic. I like to imagine our world without that place. We never got there but I know it’d be sunny, even with all the big ginkgo trees, and somewhere underneath you’re sipping your coffee and holding my feet.

I don’t know the coordinates of how or when you snuck your way into my heart, but you should know that in the capacity for which we allowed – and even for some we didn’t – I love you. Even in the midst of a contradiction so grand that there was a large wall in between the way we see the world, I could not help but press up onto my tippy toes for just another small glimpse at you, one more passing moment, a further chance to reach over and pull you to me again. How I am going to miss you.

I can’t wait to cheer you on from afar at every triumphant turn ahead of you, Aaron. Orbiting around the other “real planets” with you is something I will always cherish. And you’re right, we were real too. Please know that I am one of your biggest fans, and I will always be praying for you and that treasure of a soul you have. I hope this is a launch pad for a great big love coming your way – the forever kind – and I hope it feels like one big exhale of “ah, I’m home”. Thank you for sweet glimpses of that. I’ll be seeing you under the trees.

I do be thinkin’ bout you too doe,

Love always,

Julia",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-06-27T19:49:05.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Julia,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strongest proof of God of which I’m aware is to be in your presence. There is something about you that is more comfortable than comfort, stronger than strength, and deeper than what I’ve come to expect from ordinary interactions. Like that old scene in The Wizard of Oz, when I’m with you I feel like I’ve been lifted from the Kansas of my youth to a world of magic only to find out, finally, that there is even more to it, some force behind the curtains pulling the levers when for most people there are no curtains or force at all. (Nevermind that in the film it was just an ordinary guy behind the curtains whereas for you it’s kinda the opposite because it’s your faith; I think despite all of that the analogy still more or less works but… I digress).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about you – besides, of course, your relentless quest to extract every giggle from me with your tickling – is that I feel like I could pour into you my every daily story, deep sorrow, awful anxiety, cherished victory, wordle win, nervous skepticism, stupid thought, wishful fantasy, dumb joke, and idle dream, and you still would have room for more. I bet each of your friends would say the same thing. Yet even as you are a bottomless cup to take in the world, you yourself are constantly overflowing. Take it from an introvert like myself: it’s admirable that you’re so regularly compelled to check your experiences with your friends and seek their feedback. “I wanted a male and female perspective on this thing.” I love that about you. For all your sense of direction, you still make sure to stop and check that you’re going the right way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want you to know how I feel because at root I agree with you that this “thing” between us isn’t going to and shouldn’t lead to anything more than its current “thing”ness. We both deserve to be with someone long term who shares our family and life values, you especially deserve to be with someone who has worked equally hard in crafting his faith to be a bedrock motivation for all he does in the world. And yet it remains that I’ve come to think very fondly, very lovingly, even, of you, and if we can’t chase our feelings down whatever rabbit hole they’re beckoning us towards, we can at least shine a brighter light on them so that, looking back, we know we weren’t deceived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really do have a lot of love “for you”. And to the extent that passionate, honeymoon period-type feelings equate to real feelings, I have no problem saying that I love you. You are a beautiful woman (and a babe to top it off), but more than that you have a beautiful soul, and that’s why I don’t feel too creepy or overbearing in saying such a thing. I think anyone who takes you seriously would come to think of you with a feeling of love. But this is especially important to me because, as I’ve alluded to, I had a nasty breakup in my last relationship and, truth be told, the anger and bitterness I even now still feel from it have been, maybe to the same extend as my work travels, a major source of why I haven’t found a new relationship. So it’s with some major grace – as you might say – that I’ve met someone who I could easily see myself dating and with whom, if things were right, I would risk again falling in love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But things aren’t right; our parachutes have already been pulled to stop that sort of falling. And in two months I won’t be around nearly as often as I am now. So I don’t think any of this is too, too big of a deal. I would view our “thing” as a success if we could see each other here and there until my lease is up and, from then, if we could cheer each other on with every new turn in life – job changes, moves, and eventually, serious partners. It will be enough for me to know that what we felt was real even if it wasn’t meant to be and to know that you knew how I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, our love is like the planetary status of Pluto: technically yes, but only for a while. It never even made a full rotation around the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

"To the person I know is waiting for me someday

I never realized how attracted I was to people with such a powerful presence. How hard you must be working to gain the respect you have. How many people must've talked down to you, and still treat you like an inferior to them. But you never let that weight stop you from rising above them all. People put so much effort to hold you back because they fear how powerful you can be. The fact that you could probably take over the world if you truly wanted to.

God I adore thinking about you. I wish everyday for you to find me. To challenge me, outwit me, make me think, and to always keep me on my toes. Every second I would be around you, you'd make my head and my heart race, yet somehow you'd still be the easiest person to talk to. 

The person I can share all my dreams, thoughts, wishes and desires. Someone who will stay up with me while we share our stories knowing we could never judge the other. Only accepting and growing together. 

I know we could truly run the world if we wanted to. Someone who would dream as big as us. Someone that works their asses off to get what they want. Two badasses together would be an unstoppable force if you ask me. Just try not to let it all go to my head, just as I would do the same for you. Don't think for a second I wouldn't tease and challenge you, as I expect you to do the same. One of us will always have to take charge, we'd just be too stubborn. But I like the thought of you being the one who tries to humble me, keeping me grounded. Just as I can take control when you least expect it. 

Let's have an amazing life. Go on adventures, see the world, start a fucking empire for all I care. Let's go to Paris and sip wine doing ridiculous accents, let's fall for eachother madly and take on whatever challenges the world throws at us together.

"Hey buddy,

You've just finished crying. The last song you listened to was Guns Out by Young the Giant. Man, so much has happened in the past month. Look at how far you've come though. We both know the path to healing a broken heart isn't pretty and paved. 

I wonder how long it will take. To feel okay. To live fearlessly again. To love again. But we also know deep down, you'll be okay. You've repaired your heart before. Twice. Third time's the charm perhaps. 

Keep counting the dubs man; The videogames, the financial income, the lap times. 

And remember how strongly you know how to love. Keep her in your heart for the rest of your days. Let her be the effigy that reminds you of how strong and potent love can be. And show her how much you care about her by respecting her decision.

"Oh, V, what am I supposed to do?

My heart shakes every time I see your adorable and caring smile. My whole world quakes when those rare gems that are those eyes accompany it. 

Be it your hair, your face, your voice, everything about you is as perfect as it can get, and generates a beauty major than the sum of its parts. 

I curse the day I met you, the day that for 20 minutes my heart danced to your song, and the day we started being around each other.  I curse it, because it's gone. Gone are the days of the pandemic, where I got to see you personally very little, and my chat words could never convey what I felt for you.

The covid days are gone, and now everything's back to normal for the most part. However, that means you get to be around other, more interesting people. I can't blame you, I'm not the most interesting guy. But it kills me knowing I won't be able to be with you, to make you happy, to make you smile. All I am now, is just an Instagram follower, like all the rest. I won't be special to you, which is only natural, but undeniably painful. 

V, I want to see you. I want once more to see the most beautiful and caring woman I've meet at my short age. I want to be able to hold your hands, to warm them when they're cold. 

But what am I supposed to do? Barge into your new University life, your new friends and possible crushes? That's selfish, I can't do that. Maybe you never felt nothing for me, I gotta accept that possibility. 

We chase the same career, have the same age and like the same things. But I am worried that that would be the extent of our connection.

SAG.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-06-13T03:48:13.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, V, what am I supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My heart shakes every time I see your adorable and caring smile. My whole world quakes when those rare gems that are those eyes accompany it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be it your hair, your face, your voice, everything about you is as perfect as it can get, and generates a beauty major than the sum of its parts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I curse the day I met you, the day that for 20 minutes my heart danced to your song, and the day we started being around each other.  I curse it, because it&amp;#39;s gone. Gone are the days of the pandemic, where I got to see you personally very little, and my chat words could never convey what I felt for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The covid days are gone, and now everything&amp;#39;s back to normal for the most part. However, that means you get to be around other, more interesting people. I can&amp;#39;t blame you, I&amp;#39;m not the most interesting guy. But it kills me knowing I won&amp;#39;t be able to be with you, to make you happy, to make you smile. All I am now, is just an Instagram follower, like all the rest. I won&amp;#39;t be special to you, which is only natural, but undeniably painful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V, I want to see you. I want once more to see the most beautiful and caring woman I&amp;#39;ve meet at my short age. I want to be able to hold your hands, to warm them when they&amp;#39;re cold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what am I supposed to do? Barge into your new University life, your new friends and possible crushes? That&amp;#39;s selfish, I can&amp;#39;t do that. Maybe you never felt nothing for me, I gotta accept that possibility. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We chase the same career, have the same age and like the same things. But I am worried that that would be the extent of our connection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share my feelings with strangers on the internet, because the stakes are none. Maybe I sound desperate, but I don&amp;#39;t feel like being judged for what I feel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To everyone reading this, on this subreddit, I wish you luck, since I don&amp;#39;t have it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

When I am with you, I'm content. Not like I've settled, but you are truly enough. I want for nothing but your presence. I yearn for only your touch. I feel nothing but us any moment we are together.

"It was September 2011 in a giant chemical company in Germany. I was an intern and you were my supervisor. We had some misunderstandings but we solved our issue...

I had no idea you felt bad and kept asking updates about me by talking to another intern. You worried that I hated you but I never did!

September 2012, my internship was coming to an end. I didn't want to say goodbye to you. I worried that I would get upset, emotional and cried in front of you. I should have asked for a hug when I said goodbye to you

I had no idea I fancied you when I started dating another guy when I was back in London. When I cuddled, kissed with him, I was thinking about you the whole time... 

It has been 10 years now... I still think of you everyday. You are now in Prague because of a huge promotion. married with a son... I'm still in the UK working at a start up as a CTO

remember the conversation we had about having a beer after 10 years? It has been 10 years now, can we have a beer together?

In a few short hours it will be a week since I’ve last seen your face. The tears you were holding back as I asked you to grab your stuff. You stood in the corner challenging me, hoping I would back down. Now more than ever I wish I had. Yes it was an empty threat at first. I felt like you didn’t care about me so I thought I could get you to care more if you realized I could potentially slip away. So you grabbed your stuff and walked out. I archived all our posts together and wrote a vague message on my story announcing the news. Several factors at play, but my regret still stings the same.

Even through it all I cared about you. I reached out to your only friend so you wouldn’t be alone. I kept our memories together and got your space ready for when you come back. I counted the days hoping it would only take two for you to return. After five days I knew you were long gone.

I never meant to lose you. My behavior may have been toxic, but I blame all the articles scattered across the internet normalizing my actions. My friends put me on a pedestal for “knowing my worth” when I didn’t know how much I would be losing. My best friend of over a year, the only person in the state I could call family.

I miss him so much. Every day I wake up to a racing heart that keeps thrashing around inside my chest. My body trembling, begging to go see you. It wants to feel your soft touch again. To hear your loving voice call my name. You were the only one that respected my name. You didn’t accept the nickname I gave myself to blend in, you chose my real name and learned how to pronounce it right. You brought together the old me and the new me. Helped me heal from the trauma I was burdened with. Had it not been for you walking into my life with such grace, I wouldn’t have contacted my dad after cutting him off for so long.

I moved thousands of miles away from my family to embrace my sexuality and who I was. To avoid the years of physical and psychological abuse I was subjected to. Out in the world on my own, I never felt like I would make it. All you had to do was hold my hand and I kept putting one foot after the other till I dug myself out of holes that could have trapped me forever. You once told me you can’t replace my family, but you did a really good job at making my empty room feel like a loving home. From just a mattress you helped me put together the furniture I slowly got, reminding me every couple of months how proud you were of all the progress I made. You saw me at my lowest and loved me till I was running towards opportunities. I didn’t need family if all I had was you.

Now you’re gone and I’m back to eating alone. The pain of that twisting my heart till I lose my appetite and decide not to eat. I lay in bed hugging my pillow praying the demons will leave me alone. I play a movie in the background so when I fall asleep my mind won’t feel alone. There’s a huge gap in my life that my friends can’t replace. I see now how dependent I was. I understand now why you had to move on.

I’m afraid of dating again. All the boys I had feelings for hurt me. From being insulted to being taken advantage of, my love life has been a testimony that love doesn’t exist. I wish I could tell you how scared I was. What if someone wasn’t gentle with me? What if they hurt me? Sex wasn’t always easy for me and you were so understanding. I felt pleasure with you. I don’t think anyone else can give me that.

I paid a heavy price two years ago when I left everything behind me and traveled to a new place. My only anchor at the time was my naïve hope that I could find love. Being a hopeless romantic is a disadvantage when you hold your breaking heart. I thought you were the one. I thought destiny flew me in from the other side of the world to be with you. You were my happily ever after, now I see happiness doesn’t exist after the last page.

All I can think about is the new guy who’s going to hold you. Is he going to realize how beautiful your eyes are? Will he be better at sex than I am? Will he be more grateful to have you? I’m losing my mind as I try to conceal all my insecurities. All the comments that were glued onto me at a young age. Covering every aspect of me that presents a well established argument on why I will never be wanted. He’s going to be better than me and you’re going to be happy.

Unless, you decide loving the same sex isn’t worth the struggles it comes with. Maybe you’ll finally appease your dad and find a nice girl. Your mom will finally let you invite her over for thanksgiving and Christmas. Many people forget how difficult it is being gay. Yes we’re finally able to love who we want in public, but the public only tolerates it. I spent so much time on the outside that after dating you for a year, your family still pushed back at the idea of us. I knew you secretly struggled with that. You didn’t want to talk to me about it, because you didn’t want me to feel unwelcome.

At the start of our relationship, I warned you about my biggest insecurity. With so much internalized homophobia I knew there were a lot of things a woman can give you that I can’t. I asked if you were okay with that and I believed you when you said yes. This is no hate on you for being bisexual. I don't blame you for wanting love. I just know that seeing a pretty girl sitting next to you in the car where we used to be, will push me off the edge. It will confirm what I always feared. Being gay is impractical and I’ll never be able to love a man, because biologically I’ll never be enough.

I have received a lot of love from my friends and coworkers. Both my sisters have called me and are checking on me every morning to make sure I haven’t hurt myself. I am blessed to have a support system, but why am I so desperately wanting you back? The feelings I felt with you were real. I haven’t loved someone so hard before. I gave you so much of me and I can give you so much more. Please remember the connection we had. I know you think we’re incompatible, but you were my true love. You were the man of my dreams. You are perfect in my eyes.

Everyone’s telling me if it’s meant to be then it’s meant to be. They tell me you might come back one day. Maybe tomorrow or maybe in the next five years. I want to wait for you to come home, but if I strap myself to that grave then it will kill me when I realize years later that you will never come back. You’re stubborn like that. You don’t think we’re healthy for each other so you won’t change your mind. You let me go and you’re ready to move on. To think all it would take is for you to choose me, but denying us that opportunity. I am being forced to move on, because I don’t agree. You’re blaming the world around you on me. I love you G.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-06-20T18:06:23.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a few short hours it will be a week since I’ve last seen your face.

"My darling,

•

Anna oh Anna, what the fuck do I do?

Not an hour goes by without thinking of you

Thinking of us, and what could have been

Imagining so much, from what little I've seen

•

I miss you every day and I miss you every night

I wish I had the chance to have you in my sight

And if that day may ever come again

I'll stick with you through the high and the low

I promise I'll hold you and never let go

•

Look at what you've done

Making me rhyme like a fool

My love for you is an addiction 

But I'm trying to play it cool

•

I still wonder if you were all just a dream

How could you be so perfectly sweet?

So charming, gorgeous, and stunningly bright

You're an atheist too?! What a delight!

•

I hope you see this sometime when you think of me

I hope you are warm and safe, and taking your Vitamin D

I hope this letter makes you laugh and I hope it makes you cry

I hope the last time we spoke wasn't our last goodbye  

•

And even if it was, that's totally fine

Because I'll love you from a distance till the end of time.

I love you Anna,",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-06-12T20:45:34.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My darling,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I had the chance to have you in my sight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if that day may ever come again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll stick with you through the high and the low&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I promise I&amp;#39;ll hold you and never let go&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at what you&amp;#39;ve done&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making me rhyme like a fool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My love for you is an addiction &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m trying to play it cool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still wonder if you were all just a dream&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could you be so perfectly sweet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So charming, gorgeous, and stunningly bright&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re an atheist too?! What a delight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you see this sometime when you think of me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you are warm and safe, and taking your Vitamin D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this letter makes you laugh and I hope it makes you cry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope the last time we spoke wasn&amp;#39;t our last goodbye  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even if it was, that&amp;#39;s totally fine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;#39;ll love you from a distance till the end of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you Anna,&lt;/p&gt;

What I hope for the most. Is you coming back into my life. Where me and you are past the bull shit of the past. Where me and you can love one another. The way it should have been. Where you are mine as it always has been. Where me and you live together in loving light forever.

So, I'm asking out a girl - and I'm asking her out on Monday. Is this a good one? She's Italian btw

Mary \[name changed\]. You’re leaving. Chances are, I’ll never see you again; but hey, we can hope, eh? When I first saw you, I thought to myself “who in the fresh hell is this”. I had no idea who you were. And then, when we first talked, and you told me how you were also looking forward to Obi-Wan, I realised that I’d found a friend. Then, after I made things really awkward between us by writing that bloody “Danfiction”, I realised something. I realised that I missed you. I realised that you were like a shot of Italian Espresso, like a ray of sunlight, that made my day that little bit brighter. I realised that your sense of humour, your listening ears, and your kind heart made my day that little bit easier to get through. And when you told me that you were going back to Italy, I realised one simple thing. I like you. Like, really like you. And while I’m kicking myself for having the worst timing in the world, for not having the confidence to tell you sooner, I find myself unable to let you go without telling you, at least once, how I feel about you.

I know this is probably really embarrassing for you to read - believe me, it's embarrassing for me to write - but I’m curious: do you feel the same? If not, then I ask only for your discretion. But if you do - if I even had a chance, then please. Let me know.

The break up just added more pressure onto him. He probably doesn't have time to think or process any of his emotions. I was advised to give him space. If he can sort through all the chaos he'll probably start opening up to people and talk about our break up.

"The first time I met you after talking for months was my favorite day ever! We were paranoid and laughing driving in circles till i got to really see you the following day. I remember being nervous, but more excited than anything. I parked and walked with you inside looking at you quickly so you wouldn't notice me falling in love with you. You looked too I could feel your eyes on me from time to time. We stepped into the elevator and you hit 3. I remember thinking omg this is it! As we exited the elevator i got that super dizzy feeling after getting off elevators, but it was so much more intense. I told you that elevator makes me dizzy, but honestly it was you that made me almost crash into the wall. You opened the door and everything looked perfect. I still remember the way you smelled and the kiss that sucked the anxiety out of me. You layed back on the bed and played yellow. I laid down next to you and kissed you more and harder until I felt I could no longer resist the temptation any longer. We had talked for months everyday almost all day and night, we called, we listened to each other and built the strongest bond I ever had for anyone. I never knew someone like you existed. As I pulled off your pants and boxers my mouth watered with temptation and pure desire to make you feel how much i loved you. I licked and kissed and sucked until I finally got to taste every drop of you. I licked my lips and said,  ""I told you!"" You pulled me towards you and we kissed intensely and passionately, it didn't seem that long, but time flew that day. Then you took your magical hands and knew the softness and pressure in each area as I moaned and grabbed a pillow. Inside and out, then you knew the right moment to start putting more pressure in all the right places down there! After you made me go I could barely breathe and drank so much water, like I was dying in the desert heat. I was amazed, satisfied, tingly, and the happiest I've felt in my life, but you have to understand the emotional bond that happened first for months and months before all this. I was able to trust, open up, relax, and just feel the love in each touch you gave me. We talked, listened to music, felt up each other, kissed more, laughed, and that's when I noticed your eyes, they were the most beautiful color i have ever seen. I asked you if you knew your eyes changed colors and you said yeah kinda, depends what I'm wearing. I said no no no! This whole time I didn't notice your eyes getting brighter and brighter! It's not a color I can quite explain because they weren't hazel, not light brown, just a color with no known name in the English dictionary. It was almost like a very light colored cherry wood, but bright and I swear I could see your soul shining out into mine. I know most people won't believe this, but that's ok because I seen it and know it's true. It's my favorite color even with no name, but I don't care. It makes it all the more special to me. I've heard the saying that the eyes are windows to the soul, but honestly never seen it like that!! I could see behind the bright glow that there were dark brown areas and wondered what it meant. I had a pretty good idea, but never brought it up. I was just happy to replace the dark brown spots with the magic glow. You made me feel like the most beautiful person in the world, you made me feel special, but most importantly you loved the real me. See no one had ever seen me without my mask that I hide behind. You are the only one and that's why I don't care about anything but loving you and being with you the rest of my life. There is nothing you could do that would ever change my mind. Even through the bad times all I could do was cry and yearn for you. I realized as long as you were with me, I didn't care about physical pain, because the emotional pain of not having you was so much worse and I just couldn't deal with that. If one of us is going out than I don't think either one of us could keep on going. I know I couldn't and yes I might be fucked up, but this is my life and I like the way you make me feel and the way we obsess over each other. I'll never listen to a jealous lover who lies to get you back in her reach, by scaring me and making me leave. I'll never leave you ever again, I promise on us baby!   X",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-06-10T08:39:48.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time I met you after talking for months was my favorite day ever! We were paranoid and laughing driving in circles till i got to really see you the following day. I remember being nervous, but more excited than anything. I parked and walked with you inside looking at you quickly so you wouldn&amp;#39;t notice me falling in love with you. You looked too I could feel your eyes on me from time to time. We stepped into the elevator and you hit 3. I remember thinking omg this is it! As we exited the elevator i got that super dizzy feeling after getting off elevators, but it was so much more intense. I told you that elevator makes me dizzy, but honestly it was you that made me almost crash into the wall. You opened the door and everything looked perfect. I still remember the way you smelled and the kiss that sucked the anxiety out of me. You layed back on the bed and played yellow. I laid down next to you and kissed you more and harder until I felt I could no longer resist the temptation any longer. We had talked for months everyday almost all day and night, we called, we listened to each other and built the strongest bond I ever had for anyone. I never knew someone like you existed. As I pulled off your pants and boxers my mouth watered with temptation and pure desire to make you feel how much i loved you. I licked and kissed and sucked until I finally got to taste every drop of you. I licked my lips and said,  &amp;quot;I told you!&amp;quot; You pulled me towards you and we kissed intensely and passionately, it didn&amp;#39;t seem that long, but time flew that day. Then you took your magical hands and knew the softness and pressure in each area as I moaned and grabbed a pillow. Inside and out, then you knew the right moment to start putting more pressure in all the right places down there! After you made me go I could barely breathe and drank so much water, like I was dying in the desert heat. I was amazed, satisfied, tingly, and the happiest I&amp;#39;ve felt in my life, but you have to understand the emotional bond that happened first for months and months before all this. I was able to trust, open up, relax, and just feel the love in each touch you gave me. We talked, listened to music, felt up each other, kissed more, laughed, and that&amp;#39;s when I noticed your eyes, they were the most beautiful color i have ever seen. I asked you if you knew your eyes changed colors and you said yeah kinda, depends what I&amp;#39;m wearing. I said no no no!

"I'm happy you found someone, I'm happy if you're happy, but I won't be happy if I don't get this off my chest one way or the other. I've lived my entire life with no regrets and I intend to keep it that way. I'm aware of how childish this is. How dramatic I'm being. Love letters are things of awkward teenagers, not of adults.

I know you'd probably roll your eyes, scoff and toss away these heart felt words, you did curse me out the night I walked out of your house. You frantically begged me to let you drive me home followed by my calm insistance I walk. In those moments its like you were trying to take whatever dignity I had left, but I'm glad I loved myself enough to follow through. One foot out the door, you shouted at me to have fun being dramatic after I shared an emotional side of myself. It made me smirk because I had a feeling it was coming. ""I shall"" I said. Even though I started walking the wrong way, I walked out of there with my head held high that I made the right decision. What other choice did I have as you told me you led me on and didn't feel anything. Though I wonder if you intentionally sabatoged the possibility of us happening. That previous night you shocked me by grinding on me while I was soft, a sly smirk on your face. How desperately I wish you lent in for a kiss instead. That troubles me often to this day, almost a year later.

I told you that I liked you too much to be your friend, I liked you too much to just sleep with you, and that holds true even now. I might be annoyed and frustrated at how everything played out, how you played me. But the truth is, after my past engagement, you gave me the capacity to love again where I thought I'd swore off love to my dying day. I can't say I loved you, but there's a chance I may have if I stuck around longer. Maybe part of me did love you and I was being protective of myself. I don't know. Seeing you on Instagram makes my heartbeat echo in my ears. It's maddening. Feelings of love and affection are never easy. Most would say to let it go, I simply cannot ignore these deep feelings. 

Regardless of everything, I forgive you for playing with my feelings and maybe someday, if our roads cross again someday, things will play out differently. Part of me hopes this is the case, but the other part only wishes for you to be happy. You're smile is the most gorgeous thing about you after all.

I hate the part of me that loves you even more. She’s a ho for you. It’s daunting, honestly. If I could lock her up and compartmentalize her, that’d be great.

i don’t know what i would do without you by my  side. &lt;3

"Where I’m at in the stages of grief, I have no clue. They’re all blurring together at this point. Easy to say that I’m not ok. Nowhere near acceptance. Obviously taking it much harder than you. I can’t describe what this feels like exactly. Part of me says that this is all for nothing. She doesn’t want you, she never will again. I do not want to believe that is true. It can’t be. There was far too much that felt honestly real and loving between us for so long that it can’t mean nothing. I won’t allow it. 

I can’t forget us. I’ve tried. I’ve tried so hard to forget. Still my head rings with the memories and I can’t make it stop. Nothing I do now can even come close to being as impactful as the ones I share with you. What makes this unique is that nothing mattered to me besides your love. No amount of money, no objects, no flavor of ice cream, no fancy hotel or restaurant, no destination, nobody’s opinion, just you, and everything that came along with. It never mattered where we were, your company alone was all I wanted. You once told me that if I ever wanted out, you would completely understand. I heard you, and I listened. Every part of me said no way will I leave her. The level of loyalty to you would not be broken. I fight for you like I should fight for myself. 

Do you remember the time you were giving me a massage and I broke down because the emotions you were unlocking had been suppressed for so long?  Do you remember when you told me that you loved me? Do you remember when I opened up about my depression and abandonment? Do you remember how I told you it is a constant battle for me? Do you remember when you told me of your struggles and insecurities? Do you remember how understanding and reassuring I was of them? Do you remember the kisses in the mornings when I would leave early? Do you remember when I wouldn’t let go of you? Do you remember me sitting across from you at every special date we had and I couldn’t keep my eyes off of you? Do you remember how I always made it a point to open doors for you? Do you remember you feeling safe with me? Do you remember how you compared me to your exes? Do you remember the first time you farted in front of me? Do you remember how many times I beat you at bowling? Do you remember your teeth chattering when I took care of you? Do you remember when I was amazing? Do you remember how much I grew? Do you remember how much you grew? 

It’s too glaring to NOT notice that 
you took the pieces of me you could use, then threw me away. In many ways, you’re a better version now because of me. How many times a day can you attribute your current life to the influences I impacted you with. Be honest because it’s a staggering amount. Never once did I compare you to anyone. Not an ex girlfriend, no one. I accepted you for who you are without judgement. This concept that everyone has to look, talk, act, post this, read that, abide to this code or whatever takes away from your individuality. Everyone can always improve, and I’m proud of you for doing it your way with me supporting you. 

I really believe we are both great people that can uplift each other in life just like we have. In the end I wasn’t brave enough to be mature. I have to accept you want nothing to do with me. You made it clear you don't want me anymore and why should I want to be with someone that doesn't want me? But this hurts. My heart is broken. I have to accept that you are not able to give me what I need.

Except, I have hope. There has to be a way. There always is. There’s always hope. I have hope that I can be there again. Where the mind can be at peace and all that occupies is love and warmth. I hope you come back to your best friend some day. He misses you.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-05-23T01:15:36.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where I’m at in the stages of grief, I have no clue. They’re all blurring together at this point. Easy to say that I’m not ok. Nowhere near acceptance. Obviously taking it much harder than you. I can’t describe what this feels like exactly. Part of me says that this is all for nothing. She doesn’t want you, she never will again. I do not want to believe that is true. It can’t be. There was far too much that felt honestly real and loving between us for so long that it can’t mean nothing. I won’t allow it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t forget us. I’ve tried. I’ve tried so hard to forget. Still my head rings with the memories and I can’t make it stop. Nothing I do now can even come close to being as impactful as the ones I share with you. What makes this unique is that nothing mattered to me besides your love. No amount of money, no objects, no flavor of ice cream, no fancy hotel or restaurant, no destination, nobody’s opinion, just you, and everything that came along with. It never mattered where we were, your company alone was all I wanted. You once told me that if I ever wanted out, you would completely understand. I heard you, and I listened. Every part of me said no way will I leave her. The level of loyalty to you would not be broken. I fight for you like I should fight for myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you remember the time you were giving me a massage and I broke down because the emotions you were unlocking had been suppressed for so long?  Do you remember when you told me that you loved me? Do you remember when I opened up about my depression and abandonment? Do you remember how I told you it is a constant battle for me? Do you remember when you told me of your struggles and insecurities? Do you remember how understanding and reassuring I was of them? Do you remember the kisses in the mornings when I would leave early? Do you remember when I wouldn’t let go of you? Do you remember me sitting across from you at every special date we had and I couldn’t keep my eyes off of you? Do you remember how I always made it a point to open doors for you? Do you remember you feeling safe with me? Do you remember how you compared me to your exes? Do you remember the first time you farted in front of me? Do you remember how many times I beat you at bowling? Do you remember your teeth chattering when I took care of you? Do you remember when I was amazing? Do you remember how much I grew? Do you remember how much you grew? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s too glaring to NOT notice that 
you took the pieces of me you could use, then threw me away. In many ways, you’re a better version now because of me. How many times a day can you attribute your current life to the influences I impacted you with. Be honest because it’s a staggering amount. Never once did I compare you to anyone. Not an ex girlfriend, no one. I accepted you for who you are without judgement. This concept that everyone has to look, talk, act, post this, read that, abide to this code or whatever takes away from your individuality. Everyone can always improve, and I’m proud of you for doing it your way with me supporting you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really believe we are both great people that can uplift each other in life just like we have. In the end I wasn’t brave enough to be mature. I have to accept you want nothing to do with me. You made it clear you don&amp;#39;t want me anymore and why should I want to be with someone that doesn&amp;#39;t want me? But this hurts.

"My darling,

You cannot imagine how much of my time you occupy. Your spirit, your soul, it's all stuck in my heart. I can't get you out, and I don't want to either. 

The time we spent talking to each other feels like a euphoric dream. Some days, it feels like you are too perfect to be real. If it wasn't for our texts, I'd be convinced my mind was playing tricks on me.

I still wish you a good morning every day that I wake up, hoping somehow you'll hear me. Hoping that one day I'll see you again and never let go of you.

I remember believing that the next time I hopped on a plane, it would be to see you. It sucks that we don't get to have that chance. You were right; a small part of me will never stop wanting you. And I hate that I have to accept that. But I shall.

At some point tomorrow, I will be forty thousand feet above you. I will cling on to my seat and whisper your name. It may be the closest we get to be together again. Maybe you'll feel my love radiate from above the sky.

I never told you this but beyond the affection and desire I have for you, I will also cherish the friendship we created. You were kind, warm, caring, and attentive. I miss everything about you.

Once again, I hope you are taking care of yourself. I hope you are safe, and I hope your dreams are as sweet as you.

"Hey man,

You are laying on your bed. You've just finished crying. The last song you heard was Pizza Boy by Everything Everything.

Right now it feels like you've hit your lowest low. Your broken heart has taken a hit, you've lost some of the progress you made. You got so drunk three nights ago, that you smoked for the first time. And you blacked out.

Congratulations.

She loves you, and you love her. And she was right too. You'll love her forever and that's okay. She has a tough time ahead of her, so be as strong and sturdy as you can, for the two of you.

Let's count our blessings?

Last night you ran faster than you ever have. Keep going faster. Marathon one day. You have some beautiful friends, and they're supporting you like no one else could. Progress is being made towards leaving this godforsaken place. Keep pushing.

I love you, so please, love yourself too.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-05-06T15:59:10.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey man,&lt;/p&gt;

you said ""i dont love you anymore"" and 
i know you dont
i know youve moved on, and im happy for you, but fuck am i devastated for myself
youre the first person i fell in love with, you were everything i always wanted and i wanted to make you happy, but i was never able to was i? i wanted you to love me so bad i forgot about about loving you, and you we kept getting farther away from eachother. i hope youre happy, and for your own sake i hope you never come back, because ill always want you. ill always love you and be here for you. if you come back, ill make you stay, and i cant live with that knowing ill never make you happy. 
i hope we can meet again, under an old tree, while it rains and we can look at each other for the first time
i hope we become new people, i hope we never change and see each other again


its been almost a month
and every single day
ive thoght about you


when you told me to die that day, when you
said you wanted to tell me to kill myself
a part of me really did die, i genuinely killed the person i thought i was
the person ive became
and thats sad. and awesome. and awful. and hopeful. and i love you and i miss you and i hate you and i want you back so badly i feel my fingertips stretch to reach you
i leave unfinished coffee and go on unknown buses and i run away and i still
dont find you
i look at strangers in the eye and tell them pretty lies, and yet all i see reflected is you

pathetic isnt it? also sad. and a bit weird also. but its all i have, its all i feel, but feeling and wishing and hoping never brought anyone back. begging and running and changing also didnt bring anyone back did it? but it made you stay, even if for a while

youre loved, and youre cared for. youre worthy of love ans you deserve someone who can make you feel all of that, and more. im sorry that i couldnt be the one to do so, but i can transform missing you into an art
i can
become so good at standing it, that when it calls to me ill learn how to fill up all the little spaces you left. i can take it out of me, and put it on some paper youll never read. i can keep little pieces and memories of who we were, i can savour the good and change the past into a drowzy watercolour picture, and maybe one day

"Hi! i'm new to this subreddit and unfortunately i don't know where else to ask for help with this but i'll try and make my explanation brief.

I'm asking for help with a love confession letter to my best friend (we are both already taken and we only know each other online, however). and i'd like to make it clear to them that my love is 100% wholesome, i still want to be friends with them, and also that i'm **NOT** asking to be in a relationship with them. and i'd like some help with that! :)

This is what i have in mind so far:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hey... i'm sorry to bother you... i just wanted to tell you something i think it's way past time i told you. You probably didn't see this coming (but if i were you i would have \*at least\* suspected it) I've tried to keep this in for a \*very\* long time, but i don't know if i can anymore. I've realized that i might as well be honest with you, because i honestly don't see any better thing to do here. I mean it when i say i've never told anyone anything like this before and i just ask you to understand where i'm coming from and don't think i'm crazy...

I wanted to tell you that i love you, and no, i don't quite understand it myself. My feelings for you are much too strong for the amount we talk. Come to think of it, my feelings for you are much too strong even for the amount we \*used to\* talk. But it is what it is... So i'd like to attempt to explain myself to you.

First off. I've always seen you as someone whose social life is \*at least\* a 4 or 5 out of 10... and probably more than that. Unlike myself, I'd assume you have at least one or two friends in real life, and at least just as many online friends you know better than me. of course, you also have a girlfriend who i assume does more with \*you\* than send you repetitive emoticons and filler compliments. I can't say the same about any of that.

While on the other hand, my frequent complaints about my social life to you and on statuses you may or may not have seen are certainly no exaggeration. My entire life, i've had all of two friends, of which you have by far been the best. I've never known anyone outside of my family in real life, either. So while something like this may seem like a side thing to a normal person, it's all i've ever known.

Now, i'm not sure where to go next, perhaps now that i've gotten out of the way why i'm \*capable\* of liking you so much, i should get on with why i \*do\* like you so much.

I don't see how i couldn't, honestly! I've always looked up to you as an amazing and wonderful person, and i would describe you as better than me in every way. Sure, i know you have issues as you have discussed them with me and in servers we have both been in in the past. But to me, that doesn't make you any less perfect, everyone has their problems, i know i do. Which is another reason i love you, you, unlike almost anyone else, have always been there for me. I don't know if you've ever liked me as a friend even a little bit, or if you just figured nobody else was going to talk to me. You're the only person who's ever even attempted to understand me, no matter how small and/or petty i have found my problems at times. i am not exaggerating when saying that i wouldn't be alive right now if i had never met you. You're the only person i enjoy talking to, and for some reason i find myself thinking about you every day. I don't know how or why exactly, but i know for a fact i love you. 

Next, i would like to clarify that i am \*\*\*not\*\*\* asking to date you in any way shape or form, i know better than that, i may be too stupid to score above a C in high school, but i'm not so stupid as to ask you to be with me. I don't even see myself as good enough to be a real friend to you! let alone anything more than that. and while that fact does hurt me, it's entirely my fault, and entirely my responsibility. You don't have to tell me that's not an option, i already full well understand that.

The day i realized how strongly i felt for you was October 29, 2021. We listened to music in a voice chat that day, and at the time you had recently returned from a 3 month long absence off this website. but once we started talking again, it felt like you were never gone. I felt better than i had in \*very\* a long time back then. Every time i've ever seen you hurt, it's hurt me greatly (no joke, no exaggeration), and it's hurt me even worse that i couldn't ever do anything about it for you. \*I could never give back to you for what you've gave to me.\*

and finally, i wanted to inform you that i have removed you from my friends list. This also hurts me as you are the last, and i mean last, person i want to remove from my friends list. But i don't know if i'm in the mental state right now to worry about your response to this. \*\*\*If you're not angered by this, i would LOVE for you to add me back\*\*\*, and we can get things back to normal and maybe talk a little about this!

I'm real sorry... i didn't want to do this, i didn't want to tell you this, but i can't keep it to myself anymore, it's really beginning to affect me.

Again, I'm not asking for you to love me back, or date me, or even pretend to date me. I only ask that you're not mad at me, that you don't think i'm a creep, and maybe even understand where i'm coming from. I really wish we can still be friends after this and it would be a great loss to me if this is it. Of course, i understand if you never want to speak to me again, and i even understand if you hate me because of this. I'm sorry

Please add me back if you're not mad at me! i'll be happy to continue being your friend and answer any more questions you might have. I can't say i'm sorry enough. I'm almost crying right now thinking that i've made a terrible mistake...",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-05-11T07:15:51.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! i&amp;#39;m new to this subreddit and unfortunately i don&amp;#39;t know where else to ask for help with this but i&amp;#39;ll try and make my explanation brief.&lt;/p&gt;

"Dear (you),
I’m so happy that we have gotten to be closer as friends.
     When I left for school, I was almost worried that I’d never see you again. But things did not go well for me in university, and I came back much sooner than anyone, including myself, expected. The first time seeing you after coming back was a moment of intense internal conflict. How should I act around you? Should I ignore you? Will you ignore me? How do I talk to you? How does my mouth make sounds again?
     Needless to say, our exchange was somewhat awkward and stiff to put it lightly.
But one thing that this short encounter makes me realize is that my feelings for you did not change.
     A few months before I left, I finally confessed to you. I’d had the biggest crush on you for the longest time, but I finally told you. I thought that nothing would come of it. That, “No, of course she wouldn’t have feelings for me, that’s impossible”. Truthfully, I was both right and wrong, in a way. You did return my feelings, but I could tell that you were very hesitant at first, but for what reason I cannot be entirely sure. Yet eventually, you got more comfortable around me. We stayed up a whole night together, doing nothing but cuddling and kissing. I began to learn more about you. I saw you more often, I kissed you more often, I thought about you more often. My feelings began to deepen. But time, being cruel by nature, passed us quickly by. I had to leave for school. Somehow I think we both knew—at the same time—that it wouldn’t work if I was going to school. And so, just like that, not even a week into college, you were gone. 
     I tried distracting myself by meeting new people. I tried to memorize all of the people in my residence hall—to no avail, of course. I tried burying myself in my studies. I tried focusing on clubs, and climbing, and sports. I even tried dating someone else. A girl I had met early in my first week while playing a pickup game of sand volleyball. She did a fair job of distracting me, but that relationship ended as quickly as it began and soon enough, I was alone again, and my thoughts returned to you. Even as things continued to go poorly with school, my thoughts would return to you. 
     So, now I’m back, and here we are again, playing the part of friends. It’s so wonderful to see you every week, to spend time with you again. And through it all, my feelings remain. I know you told me that you just want to be friends. I will respect that. I’m happy any chance I get to just be with you.
     But still, am I wrong to say that I feel something? Every moment with you feels like it lasts forever, yet it always ends too soon. We sit by each other, we stay up late together, we laugh together. When our elbows would touch, the sensation is so sharp, it’s almost unbearable. It’s impossible to look in your eyes, because I want to just stare at you. It’s impossible to look at your lips, because I want to just kiss you. It’s impossible to look at your arms, because I want to be held by you. Every time we part, I feel a tension. Before, you’d kiss me against my car as goodbye. Now, it’s a smile and a wave. 
     I’m trying—believe me, I’m trying—to keep my distance. But last night, you sat right beside me. You leaned against my side for hours. You laid your head on my shoulder for a moment. You stayed with me alone into early morning. You stayed until I said we should go. You walked beside me in silence. You hugged me goodbye.
     So, unable to sort myself out, I drove home and wrote this letter to you. Gradually, my jumbled feelings are becoming clear, and I’ve come to realize the truth; I’ve fallen in love with you.
     As I’ve said before, I will continue to respect your wishes. I will keep my distance. I will hold these feelings in my heart. I may never show this letter to you. That’s ok. I still love you.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-04-21T10:42:30.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear (you),

"I wonder off in my head to go think of you.

I leave my reality, my world that I’m finally happy in, and I still just like to wonder… *what if….* 

That night I met you, you hit me like a freight train. Maybe I was still a bit tipsy off wine, or maybe it was intoxicating enough to be around you. 

There was something so different about you and I loved it. You made me feel butterflies I didn’t normally feel— you were supposed to be another man I had a fun night with, not a lover I lost. 

That’s what it feels like sometimes, like I lost you. Our world turned upside down and there was nothing anybody could do about it. One moment we were walking down the frozen dark streets of the city- laughing, chatting, kissing- and then the next week the city streets were bare, and we hadn’t spoken a word to one another since our petty argument. 

I like to think about a time where the world stayed right side up, at least long enough for us to have made something out of whatever it was we were becoming. 

Do you think we would’ve worked out? Part of me yearns to hear a yes from your lips, the same ones that took my breath away when you kissed me. One time, we were laying in your bed together. I was squished in between you and the wall, happily looking up at you. We started talking about bad kissers… 

*“Some people are just bad at kissing!”* You exclaimed, smiling. 

I agreed, but had to push your buttons- *“I think some people just kiss differently, I don’t think you can intentionally be good or bad.”*

I smiled then, because I was going to get what I wanted. 

You kissed me. Sloppily, closely, simply. *“Now was that good?”*

I opened my mouth to reply, but before I could you leaned in and kissed me again. I didn’t quite realize how good you really were at kissing until that moment you kissed me with so much passion and intention that you left me breathless. 

I wish I could get one more kiss like that from you, sometimes. 

I feel guilty writing all of this, telling you how much I miss and yearn for you. I have someone I love dearly, more than I think I loved you in those moments you swept me out of reality. 

I don’t know what it is about you, I can’t help but let my mind wonder into the great possibilities that float throughout my imagination. I still look at your Facebook to see your face. I look at you mom’s to look at even more recent photos of you and sometimes picture myself next to you, too. 

Would you ever take me back? If the odds ever worked in our favor and we found ourselves alone for a night, would you take the time to rekindle the light we had or to reminisce about the ravenous sex we had? 

I hate to say it, but I would take any one night with you if I was given the opportunity. My curiosity makes me want to find out just what it is you think about me, if you feel anything towards me at all anymore. 

Sometimes I imagine us meeting again in the same streets we found each other on. I always am dressed nicely after just giving a presentation, on what, I have no idea, but that’s what I think. 

I imagine seeing you, dressed in khakis and a button up, wearing your satchel and watch. You would look at me with those deep brown eyes that were always so full of lust and adventure. I’d freeze at the sight of you, stunned that I even got to see you in front of me again. 

You’d flirt or make a comment on how I’d look- something blunt enough for me to know you noticed how much my body has changed since you last held your hands on it.

I imagine sometimes we go to the pond behind your office building, and other times I imagine we finally go to a bar together, now that I’m legal. We’d get drunk and talk about our memories together, we’d fill each other in on what we’ve been up to as we wondered different paths in our time apart. 

I never know if we end up in your bed, a hotel bed, or anywhere at all. I don’t know if we’d make it that far or if my brain keeps me from going that far to protect my love. I don’t know.

"My darling,

It's been a whole month since we were last in touch. I still can't stop thinking about you. I still miss you more than you can imagine. And everything still hurts as much as the day you told me no.

I've had a rollercoaster of emotions this past week. There were nights I wish we never met. There were days I wish you never told me how you felt. There were days I wanted to scream in anger and frustration.

I'm going to keep loving you as always Anna. I'm going to be the strong person you know I can be. I will maintain my dignity and respect the choice you made.

This experience, as much as it hurts, taught me so many valuable things about myself and when I look back at it from the future, I will regret nothing.

I hope you are well and safe. Keep listening to music. Keeping being a badass. Keep being the beautiful soul that you are.

Hello, 

Do you know what it feels like to be unworthy? 

My first and only true love stole My heart. The love I had for him was the kind you read about in books. No one will ever love him as unconditionally as I did. As I still do. But even though I gave him everything he betrayed my heart. It fell to pieces. After 20 years my heart still shows cracks where it was glued back together.  
The piece of my heart collecting dust in his closet still feels unworthy. 

I found another love not long after who took a tiny nugget of my heart. He didn’t look at me the next morning or even say goodbye before he left. I never heard from him again. 
The nugget of my heart that lives in his pocket still feels unworthy.

There were many, many loves after this and they each took a piece of my heart. Some bigger. Some smaller. They shamed my body, my pussy, my mind, my confidence, and my life.  
Each piece of my heart that they took lingers on the soles of their shoes and still feels unworthy.

I finally found another special love. He claimed a giant section of my heart. He fucked me for a while then left me, then came back and loved me, then was forced to marry me after he put a child in me. We had two more kids and were happy. Indeed, I always wondered whether he would have married me without the baby. He is flushing away chunk after chunk of his section of my heart. He’s pushing me away. 
Those chunks of my heart float in the sewer and feel unworthy. 

I got a job and found a family there. I worked so hard and grew so much and felt passion, value, and satisfaction. They peeled off layers of my heart and adopted them as their own. I never wanted to leave. I was so happy.  But one day my job no longer wanted me. 
Their layers of my heart got stuck in the door on the way out and still feel unworthy 

My mother died. The forcefield protecting my heart disappeared in an instant. My heart has been missing her heart every second of everyday and still feels unworthy. 

Our three children were given the rest of my heart. I’ve wrapped them in it’s love. It’s the warmest, softest, most comfortable part of my heart. It’s shelter doesn’t always protect my babies and is beginning to burden them with failure. Would they be happier without me? Regardless, my heart will always walk next to them and never feel worthy enough to be their mother.

I found him again. My true love. The piece of my heart in his closet was dusted off and brought back to life. He became a friend when I needed one, and reignited the dying embers my husband flushed away. He gave me hope and confidence and desire. I  started dreaming of our love again at night. It awakened me.  

What was I thinking? My heart is not worthy enough to enjoy a happily ever after. I decided to give him that piece of my heart back and asked him to hide it back in the closet. I cannot walk away from my marriage and disappoint everyone. I cannot be selfish. My happiness doesn’t matter.

The pain is unbearable. I want to be with him more than anything. I am sad and lonely without him. I can’t stop thinking of him and what it would feel like to kiss him again. To hear his voice. To see his smile.  To be with him.  It would be living out the greatest dream of my life. Maybe my heart would feel worthy. 

I’ll never know. And my unworthy hearts weeps.",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-04-20T03:50:18.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;/p&gt;

"you are the person 
that comes to
my mind 
every time 
heatwaves plays
and suddenly 
the summer we graced paths 
comes flooding to my mind
you know for a person i’ve only met once’s
you take up a huge space in my heart
because for you maybe
i was just another traveler
stumbling into your bar top
but for me you are london 
you are there every time i hear
glass animals, tash sultana 
and every single artist you showed me
and even 
you come to mind with every travel j go in
because you are the first person i befriended
on my first journey out of the country 
but more than all of that you are , sara 
a girl, a woman
who encompasses all of the beauty and confidence people attend seminars and read books
in a futile attempt to acquire a mere shred of that you possess
but of all your traits it was your kindness 
your pure kindness
that sunk into my heart 
and i can never repay 
maybe it was youth and blissful optimism that made me underestimate the  limitations 
of the physical space between us
the financial limitations of adulthood
that kept us from ever meeting a second time after that day
and once you shut the door and left to work
i’d never see you again
and i guess that’s just how it is for some
people
i just always thought i’d see you again at the train station or i’d find you and you’d finally make it to the shores of malibu 
or whatever place  your heart grew 
infatuated with in the time that passed since we last met 
i remember that 24 hours.

we were descending  and i watched  the carpet of clouds beneath my window collapse into a foggy collection of streets and houses that is london
and knowing that you were in one of those houses or one of those streets
made me reassured 
and thank God i walked into your bar 
on a last ditch effort to experience a hostel bar before i departed to the continent 
and thank God i had you 
to offer me a bed to stay in
because my pockets were empty and my feet were blistered 
and i was sick
and i was starving 
but i had a warm bed to stay in
and that’s all i needed 
we landed and from the airport we navigated to the trains
and from the trains we navigated to kings cross  station 
and from kings cross i navigated to a in front of the hostel their was a crowd of youths, of boys, 
i became lost in it 
and in this crowd i caught a pair of brown eyes staring at me
and then these brown eyes embraced me
and i found myself in the arms 
of a person 
who i’ve never even met 
on this side of the bartop
and i found myself for the first time
in weeks of weariness 
in the arms of someone slightly more than a stranger
and knowing that this stranger cared about my fate 
changed everything 
we talked for a moment, and then you slipped me a note 
so neatly written, with directions to your flat. with what busses or trains to ride i took it and thanked you
you told me you had to rush back to
work
and so we went our way and you went back to yours 
by the time i got through the tube ride to stebney green and finally
to your flat
i dropped everything, i showered, i collapsed 
thanking you every moment
for the warm bed beneath me
the next morning i awoke sicker than a dog and exhausted.
you came over.
nick made friends with your flat mate and we went on our walk 
to mile end park 
i don’t think london has ever had a day as warm and beautiful and the one we spent in mile end park. we enjoyed watching ducks tussle in the water and we sat in the grass
i watched you throw a ball  
to a dog you had just met
in this i saw your affection for strangers person or animal
i tried my best to put into words what i had experienced the past two weeks, but the sickness and exhaustion made it difficult. 
and i found myself captivated by the elegance of your language and words 
i had never met someone who so conveyed beauty and intelligence like you
so this is what European girls are like i thought to myself 
grateful for your friendship but still i couldn’t help but think 
thought for just a minute how it would feel to kiss you 
but i was sick and you had a busy busy life
i couldn’t ruin all of that for you by spreading my continental  flu
and even if i wasn’t sick i didn’t want to lose your friendship over a kiss
so i pushed it aside
we walked home and before getting all the way there we stopped at a grocery store
and you bought us groceries
and i know damn well you were just as limited on money as any university student is
i couldn’t believe your generousity. 
we came inside and just as i began to cook.
you let me know you had to depart
back to the place where i first met you
we embraced a last time and i thanked you for the past 24 hours 
and we made our promises to meet again 
blissfully ignorant of how much life would change for us in between
i watched you leave 
and i cursed myself for being so foggy minded and tired and not having enough time
and  i thanked the universe for the miracle of canceled flights and befriending bartenders in hostel barrooms.  and being stuck in london another 2 nights 
and i made a promise i would come back. 
no matter what it cost me
because 24 hours wasn’t enough time

"My darling,

It's been less than a week since you told me no. Since you told me that you love me, but just not enough to risk it all. You didn't do anything wrong. You set the rules of the game seven months ago and I played even though the odds were stacked against me. I went all in with my heart, and here I am. 

When you told me that I drove you crazy, I was ecstatic, I didn't know I could make someone feel that way, much less from a mere 5 minutes in a warehouse in Venice. I wish I could go back to that day. 

Anna, I didn't know how perfect you could be. Your heart is filled with love, maybe even too much, and I wanted to give you all of mine as well.

The pain of never being able to talk to you again stings harder than anything I've had to bear. The thought of you with someone else is burned in my soul. Who is going to listen to me talk about videogames and Hot Wheels all day? You're the only person who's loved me this way and now my soul is empty.

But I know that you made a decision with your mind, and I'm sure that will pay it's dividends in due time, for both of us. 

Anna, I hope he makes you happy, I hope he fills your heart with all the joy you deserve. I hope that the two of you grow stronger together with every passing day. 

You gave me hope in myself. That one day eventually, I will find my companion whom I will give my heart to. Today I still wish that was you, but in time, it will be the one who is right for me.

I love you Anna,

It's been two weeks since we last spoke. It feels a lot longer though, time is moving achingly slow and you're still the only thing on my mind. Five minutes can't go by without thinking of you. Thinking of what it used to be like and unfortunately, thinking of what it could have been.

I miss you so much, the good mornings and good nights. Everything feels so empty without you. I hope that I can find my way out of this mess I've put myself in.

I want to reach out to you, it's taking a massive amount of determination to not to do that. I've realized the only way I can love you now is by respecting the choice you've made.

I guess I now know what it feels like to have love burst into flames rather than fizzle away. It's hard. It's debilitating. It's agonizing.

"I think about you as i fall asleep

I think about you while you're at work, as I patiently await your return.

You come in the door, with that sweet stupid, smile, and maybe if even for a second, my mind is at ease. 

It’s as though the racing thoughts sit down and take in a deep breathe. Allowing the fresh, pure, air to enter my lungs and revive my soul.

Sometimes when I look at you, just observing you in your natural state, I become perplexed by your existence and how I have become so entangled in it with you.

you challenge me.

Just being around you softens my interior and pushes me to corners in which i'd rather not see.

My time with you has become increasingly more fulfilling.

I've wresteled with this and how it tethers to my own insecurities. 

I would have ran, if I could have..

but your energy has been so enticing that I have remained in place, feet grounded in soil.

From the moment I saw you, my intuition has surpassed my human inconsistinceies regarding thoughts and actions.

Maybe thats why i couldnt breathe when I would talk to you.

Being with you feels like taking a walk in the most desolate garden full of flowers beyond the eye can see.

" 

I'm sad I'll never be able to give you this,

I needed to write this even though I know you wont ever get to read it or maybe even care to know my heart again. I wish things were different, but at the same time my intuition tells me this is where we need to be. A slow place, a friendship that grows over time that heals broken hearts. Maybe one day you'll look in my eyes again and realize it was me all along you have been searching for. I still hold out that one day you'll want that little house on a hill with me, it'd just take time and I'd be okay with that.

You probably think that you're someone to easily be forgotten or given up on, that you ruin good things or just cause pain. I wish I got the chance to put into words how different you are, despite all your flaws. You have fought so hard and I can see a strength in you that you struggle to see. The pain that you've buried so deep you lash out as soon as someone gets too close to that big, broken heart of yours. Despite all that I think you're utterly wonderful, I wish I could explain it so that you could understand and maybe see the 'you' that I see.

The way I feel about you is the first time I've ever felt this way, I thought I knew what love was in the past. You were never some quick fling or some kind of band-aid for my heart. Even if us coming together took time, for once I was content and patient with that it just felt natural. I felt loved despite not being called by that title. You're not easily replaceable. And it's not for what you can do for me, it's just who you are. You don't have to love me back, and maybe you never did... I could be an idiot for that, for sure. But even if all we are is just friends until our last days, I want to cheer you on and watch over you while you grow and thrive. Even if it's not with me I hope one day I have the strength to watch you be happy with someone else.

Hands are like cages; sometimes holding on to hope when really we need to set it free.

Since I've been working on myself and moving forward boys have started to show interest and people are enjoying my spirit and love my energy but I can't help but wish that every face is yours, the voices I hear laughing down the end of my earphones are yours in your element. The laugh where I can hear your smile reach your eyes. If I had a room filled with all the people I've ever loved, I'd seek out you. I was never afraid to travel to be with you. I'd have moved mountains and enjoyed it all. I was never scared;  never afraid of anything ...other than losing you... But you were never mine to hold.

Thank you for loving me in your own way

Dear Lilly,  
 

I can understand your hesitancy in picking up the phone. Why now? What could I possibly have to say? The irony is I’ve tried writing this particular letter many times over the year. Until now, I have failed on every occasion for reasons I soon hope to make clear to you. In the end, I thought a call was the only way I could explain anything at all. This was the wrong thing to do, and is the first of many apologies. I will respect your wishes, and try my best to put it into writing instead. I expect nothing in return –not even a reply- only that you read it. We never lied to each other Lilly, and I am going to say what has needed to be said for the longest time. I am accountable for so much, and have no one else to blame. This is about detailing what has been the coldest year of my life, and trying to explain everything that has led me to reach out to you. It’s difficult to even know where to start, and what does follow will be hard to read. But here we go.   
 

Firstly, I want to say I am so sorry for *everything*.   
 

I’m sorry for how things turned out, I’m sorry for how much I must have had hurt you, I’m sorry for not saying you hadn’t done anything wrong, I’m sorry I didn’t have the courage to talk to you in person, I’m sorry I didn’t give you so much as a hint as to an explanation why I left, I am sorry I couldn’t voice what was going on in my messed up head. I am so sorry I didn’t ask for the help I so terribly needed. At the time, I couldn’t begin to describe the hopelessness I was feeling. I simply did not know what I do know now, all at the beginning of the end of *us*.   
 

In a way it’s easier to start from the present and work backwards, because everything is connected in this story. As does the way it all leads back to you, Lily. Earlier this year, I was finally diagnosed with severe depression. Not just the everyday type of sadness, no. It is the biological, uncontrollable, *crippling* kind of depression akin to bi-polar. Much like the way it found my Dad and my brother, it has found me too. It was present long before its diagnosis; like when I was growing up, during school, even the time we were a couple. Although when we were together, I was so happy Lilly. It was familiar, and I was safe in the knowledge that you were a constant. You were my rock. You were my best friend. You were someone I could trust in revealing the most emotional and vulnerable parts of myself. You were all I ever needed. I loved you. A big part of me still does. And it will continue to do so. And still, I took you for granted.   
 

I want to reassure that you were never the cause of me feeling so lost, Lily. In fact, as cruelly as hindsight allows, I now realise you were the only light I had during times I felt there was no escape from the darkness. After the bubble that was university, that darkness became far less controllable. As soon as we ended, it suddenly covered the world. In a weird way the diagnosis came as a relief. The doctor had finally given a name to what I had been so desperately at war with all this time.  
 

When I think back over the nearly 4 years we were together, I remember the times when the black fog settled in and the ways it then manifested in my behaviour. While I am entirely accountable for my actions, I often acted out for reasons I am not entirely sure off until now. You might remember the constant tiredness, my reluctance to travel (or often even to leave the house at all) and the obsessive behaviour (like wanting to get super strong all the time, to feel like I could protect people). It’s the latter that’s important, as it’s the reason why something so special came to an end.  This obsessive behaviour went hand in hand with anxiety, and the worry that I was never doing the right thing at the right time. This was responsible for the delusions of grandeur I held about the future. You know the ones; joining the army and being a hero, teaching English half way across the world etc. All that rubbish. For the most part, I refused to acknowledge I was ill. The thought crossed my mind on many occasions, but after seeing what my Dad went through just to get settled, you could forgive me in wanting to avoid coming to that conclusion. Let alone to share this worry with someone I was close to. What if you thought I was crazy? Would your wonderful family want me to be with you? Would my family feel guilty? Would I have to start taking pills just to feel normal again? So I ignored it.  
 

At the time, I did feel we had problems in our relationship. The physical distance between us, even a couple of hours away by train, felt so much larger in practice. From working in the hell that was the call centre, to looking for a new job after that, setting time and money aside to see you regularly was becoming a source of stress. When I saw you, of course, these feelings were quickly forgotten, but I was always dreading the ride home as I knew the happy momentum we had built over the many trips would be broken yet again for weeks at a time. But looking back, these ‘problems’… they were so *manageable* that they weren’t really problems at all. If I had only looked past the anxiety that was blowing them out of proportion…things might have been different. I take full responsibility, of course. I should have made the effort to see you more, I should have had the foresight that if I had waited just a while longer, that at 24, being that much more mature, I would be have been ready to move in with you. The phrase “too little, too late” springs to mind.   
 

And this brings us to the weekend of the convention I went to with Rory, and the biggest regret of my life in thinking the only option was to break us apart. Though I didn’t realise it, at the time I was probably at the peak of one of my depressive episodes. Come to think of it, April has always been a terrible time. It started all started with Phillip’s death in third year…Even so, I still made the choice to go without you, and ended up socialising with other girls. Nothing happened, Lilly. I didn’t betray your trust – I never did. That was never part of me. But I wrongly thought there was more to life, other than that which I already had. I thought there was more yet to experience, away from us. Simply put, I felt guilty pretending I was single in front of people I didn’t know during that weekend. When I got home, I concluded I didn’t deserve you (I still don’t) and thought you could ultimately be so much happier without me (I still do). The rest we already know. I made a snap decision without even confiding in you, and I broke us up with a cruel whimper of an excuse over the phone like the coward I was.  
 

The next part of this letter is secondary to me saying sorry for what I’ve done to you. Nothing will ever be as important, but I hope you continue reading.   
 

The following couple of months were spent lamenting the fact I had lost a tender part of me. Distance aside, our phone call everyday was part of a beloved routine. Suddenly I was alone. All the cliché post break-up reassurances were thrown my way: “Give it a few weeks, and you’ll be fine.” “Go out and find yourself someone else – you’ll forget her soon enough.” They were wrong. I didn’t get out of bed, my motivation was shot, and I started drinking (I’m sober now) to feel anything other than a relentless numbness of spirit. I kept thinking what you were doing. It was almost like a state of dramatic shock, like us being torn apart was a poorly written plot in a panto. Some days, I half expected another visit from you. Other days, I boarded a train to Wales with the intent of seeing you any way I could. I nearly always ended up getting off at the first stop, in tears. April bled into summer, and I spent it freelancing as a cameraman for a performer that travelled the country. It took my mind off things, it was all the money I could earn and give to my parents, but I was wearing a mask to the world. Then Bart died.  
 

This is significant as it was the day I pretty much gave up on people. And I lost interest in what life had to offer. We both knew he was an old cat, and we knew it would happen one day. But it was the *way* he died, Lilly.  He was stoned and beaten to death by a group of kids near my parents’ house. I had him on my lap purring away only that  very morning. He was probably waiting to greet the children on their way back  from school, like he usually did. I found him dying, a mess, and ran to the  vet just to have him put to sleep. I was the last thing he saw. I didn’t know  what fully happened that day until sometime after. But the sense of loss was  devastating. How could anyone be so cruel? He was my best friend, and I loved him  with all my heart. I had now lost you and Bart. It felt like some twisted karma.  This sent me into a downward spiral. I was at rock-bottom. The email I sent you to tell you what happened was a bitter sweet moment. You  didn’t have to give me the photo’s you had taken of your time with Bart, but you  did. It confirmed what I already knew in that you were the *kindest* woman I had ever met. You were someone that saw the good in everyone, someone who truly cared about others. You saw the good in me, even when I didn’t.   
 

From then on, I kept seeing your face every time I closed my eyes. I saw your smile, and heard your laugh. I dreamt of the times we cooked dinners, constructed gingerbread houses and sat silently atop a windy hill in each other’s arms. I relived the parties we dressed up as silly characters, smelling the flowers in the gardens we walked in, hearing the explosions of fireworks at New Years and the music of seedy clubs as we danced the night away. I savoured the taste of M&amp;S cookies and the soft skin of your rosy cheeks. Lilly, I saw again the day we graduated and felt the pride when being introduced as yours to your friends. I missed you so, so much. I still miss you *so*, *so much*. I could have called, but I didn’t. I could have sent you a message, but I didn’t. I did nothing other than think of a future that would no longer be. I had passed up on a life of happiness and a life of love; a life with Arthur and Evelyn, and a house by the sea.   
 

During this time, I kept sinking further down. Part of the problem lay with my parents, of whom you know I have always honest with. It was obvious they loved and missed you too, Lilly - especially my Mum. She thought I had found my ‘One.’ She reminded me of the fact a lot, whenever it was brought up. Like your parents, they had met early on in life. They believed in that kind of love story. Seeing their disappointed faces daily, at what their son had done and was slowly becoming, further added to the hopelessness I was feeling. Thus, my own sense of worthlessness stopped me from ever attempting to make amends. Truthfully, Lilly, I have thought about you every single day without fail - a whole year. Often, you are my first thought of the day and the last before sleep. I can simply not forget, let it go, or move on, without knowing you are happy. Because that is all I ever wanted in the end, whether it was with me or otherwise. I just wanted you to have a life that someone as wonderful as you deserved to have.  
 

And that draws me to the final part of the letter, and arguably the  hardest part to write. It’s difficult because I’m finally putting into words the  cold reality of the situation. I gave up the greatest thing in my life; I  hurt the one person that loved me in this entire world. I now have to live with  that. I am so terribly sorry. I don’t deserve your forgiveness, or ask for it. I  only wish you to understand what brought me to this dark place, with hope  that I can one day see you again (and share a pannad). I know from asking around  that you are with someone new. I hear he is close to home, too. That’s great. I sincerely hope he gives you everything I never could, and that he makes  you happy. If he has any sense at all, he will marry you. As I should  have done. Send my love to your folks, your brother Paul and your grandma. They were so kind to me, I will never  forget them.  
 

Before I go, I just want to say I will only ever feel a softly heart-breaking warmth for you Lily. The kind only the thought of my first love could bring. Thank you so much – I owe so many wonderful years to you. The time we spent together was truly the happiest time of my life, and I know that now. After all this, it’s hard to believe in something like fate anymore. But who knows – I really do hope I’m wrong.   
 

I will love you, always.

"Dear Charlotte 
Monday February 7th 2022. I came over to your house, I met your parents.

We sat on the couch in your basement played chess and laughed. There never was a game I could beat you in. You always won but I was never upset.

We went to your room and you won at cards. Six, seven hands with the score seven to none. You wouldn’t have been happy with a score of six to one.

We laid on you bed and listened to music. I swear it’s still my favorite playlist.

You said you liked me and I said it back to you. 

We were listening to music I sang along to the song and you just smiled. “Stacy let me kiss her forehead” I still love that song. It reminds me of you. There was a light in your eyes as if you realized something.

You whispered “can I kiss your forehead” I blushed but the lights were pink so you couldn’t see. I smiled and said yes.

Then you said sorry and I was confused. I said you shouldn’t apologize. You kissed your forehead too.

You kept smiling and saying how happy you were. I still love your smile.

We held hands and held each other so close.

Then you drove me home and a few hours later you said you weren’t ready for a relationship.

I still love you. I’ve written so many love letters and never given you a single one.

And maybe someday you’ll find those letters or I’ll build up the courage to give you just one. But written in a language you don’t speak. I’ll have closure and you’ll be confused.

So, 
      If you find those pictures of us, please clear away the dust and miss me just once. &lt;3",,"r/LoveLetters","2022-02-11T00:15:52.000Z","post",,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Charlotte

Please don't leave me, please don't hurt me. I trust you not to. I try to not let the past dictate how I feel, it's taken a lot of time for me to be able to trust you like this. I'm sorry about that. 

You've taught me how to live in the moment. I will forever be thankful for that, no matter what happens to us. Fear has loosened its grasp on me. 

I want to live in the moment with you, for the rest of my life.

I want to have a family with you, out on a ranch in the country. I want to be your woman. I want to go on adventures, eat delicious food, and play together.

I called you my beautiful distraction. Which I thought was a cute little nickname. Quickly I realized you were far more then a silly nick name.

You are not a distraction, you are not my therapy, you are not a crutch. Out of billions of people, all the choices we have made, lead us to one another. 

On the great days, we will love each other with all we can. It's little reminders that keep us focused.

Not every day is great, and not every day will be.


We spiral sometimes. Sometimes out of control. You know how to reel me in. Me, I'm still learning, focusing on how to help you through it rather then make it go away.

&lt;p&gt;Not every day is great, and not every day will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spiral sometimes. Sometimes out of control. You know how to reel me in. Me, I&amp;#39;m still learning, focusing on how to help you through it rather then make it go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On those days, the days the chaos is our oxygen. I love you more. I&amp;#39;ve listened and learned the hard way, we both have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love you always
And on the hard days, I love you endlessly&lt;/p&gt;

"Hello knight of wands, 

 I handled it too maturely. Didn't I? I handled it in a way no different then littering into a busy highway. I handled it in a way where it only needlessly polluted the earth, as if I robbed the world of my passion. Now I feel myself burning because of it. The engine that is my mind continues to run even in my dreams. I yearn for you to truly know how I felt, because if you knew you would not be so nice to me. You would have the common sense to outright ditch me and take off, similar to a sketchy hitchhiker you see waving their thumb at each passing car.   

Now I wait and brace for impact. The type of impact a pedestrian feels when they know they're going to get hit by a car. Except, I wait for a love that may or may not come. I watch stupid tarot videos; the same cards that told me to follow you. The fortune reader only promise of an even bigger false reality that one day you'd reciprocate. I want that car to hit me. I confessed because I wanted an end, but now I find myself getting up and willingly walking into an empty street, waiting. As the headlights shine into my eyes, I can only see you in the light and find myself brace for that impact.

"Darling,  my heart continues to ache for you. Why has God separated us when he sent us to this Earth? Perhaps to make our love stronger for when we finally reunite. 

Our passion for each other will be unlike any other. For lovers surrounding have had their time during their youth. Perhaps the longer a love cooks in longing, the more tender it becomes. 

I long to kiss you.

I long to hold you.

I long to laugh with you. 

But I know that patience is a virtue. 

We will meet soon, Insha’Allah. But until then.

"I don't need anything but a place to brag. I just thought this might be a good place to put these thoughts out and let me glow about my girlfriend for a while. I really don't do this enough and I probably should shout from the top of every possible roof and mountain about how incredible she is and how much I love her.

It's her eyes that made me first completely attracted to her. We met online so the first thing that got me hooked was just how incredibly beautiful she was. And it absolutely was her eyes. I get lost in them every single time I look at her and it's her gaze and the way she looks at me that makes me feel like I'm the only man in the entire world for her. I look like an utter dork in every picture but when we take shots together and she's looking up at me with stars in her eyes, it's the best feeling I've ever felt in my life.

The second most amazing quality is her unrelenting and continuing love for me. Look, I'm a guy and I absolutely screw up A LOT. But where so many other women would write me off, send me on my way and never have anything to do with me ever again, she never stops loving me. She never stops telling me that she's there for me. She's seen me through some of the darkest periods and is always there on the other side for me. She gives me her love and affection and it makes me feel like the luckiest person in the world just to have her heart focused on me.

Finally, she's absolutely invaded my heart and soul completely. And not in a negative way at all. When we first met, I was a little bit (ok, a lotta bit) resistant to letting ANYONE in that close. But after two years with her, sharing so many wonderful experiences and building our life together...she softened me to the point where I wanted her to come in. She sat out on the front porch of my heart patiently waiting there for me to turn on the light and ask her to come in for coffee. And now she's here and I never want her to leave.

"Hi,
I am a film school student from Poland, and I’m working on photography project about any kinds of relationships. For my project I need “love letters”. I’m not thinking about the most typical love letters, but more like letters, messages, notes you never sent that you wrote during an argument. Everything that you couldn’t say to that person, but had to get out of you to deal with how they hurt you (or you hurt them). These letters often aren’t too nice, but that’s the point.
My project is a tribute to the duality of relationships. How they are so important, so crucial, so beautiful and at the same time so difficult to handle. How we can love someone but have a hard time forgetting, trusting someone again. And yet we still try, because what else could we do.
I’ll be thankful for you help. Project is anonymous and it will consist of pictures of people together with fragments of those letters.
I wish you lots of love, friendship and kindness.

I think we all know my last love focus was unable to follow through we had too many problems in our way. So yes of course yes! Do not be silly but I&amp;#39;m not going first out there please stop me talk to me and help me. I need a you now and that&amp;#39;s not to say I have to have someone because I&amp;#39;ve been alone far too long. But I want to see how much I could love you don&amp;#39;t you want to know if you could be loved all the way totally. No questions ever only love trust and us! Try it out one day with me if you think you can keep from abandoning me like everyone else. I&amp;#39;ll love you the way you imagined it would always be I promise!&lt;/p&gt;

"So I am starting to place some to a little more than that maybe together. I've loved you a long time at first I wanted you to know I was very happy to have met you meant enough to me I thought this is love and it was. So I talked to someone about it and they gave advice I should have left. I left out that I wasn't ino love with you not yet anyways that was to come in a very big way soon enough. So there I am one day I think we were talking and I was just so compelled to pull you in with my right hand gentlely place on the back of your beautiful head. I invisioned pulling you in slowly meeting your lips with mine kissing you softly to more firmly and just that right amount of tounge as my left arm and hand move into caressing mode. Than like lightening striking my thoughts a wtf you thinking moment. Because I took that bad advice I was privy to words that created so many doubts. I know you think actions rule the hill well they both do and do not. Words have a ton of power especially the more ears there are to hear they become even more powerful to the one who spoke them. You spoke yourself out of ever being with me I've known this all a long still I loved you so much moving on wasn't an option and truth is I thought you might say fuck them all I'm in love and that's the important stuff not those who covet what I am. So years started rolling on and now I watched as you went down hill the whole while I could do exactly nothing to prevent it.  I regret running more than once because it turns out you were victimized while I was gone. I always wondered why so many didn't like me being anywhere near you. Now I know they could never get away with it if I was.

"The first time we meet I knew you were something special, I didn't think much of it at first, all I knew was that I felt warm inside. After that I started to notice your ever quirk, I began to realise that I wanted to be with you.

Then one day came and we did it, we now were together, I couldn't believe it. The little insecure person I was, was not ready, even though I really wanted to be, I wanted you to be with me all the time. I started to feel insecure when you were with others, I hated that feeling... I didn't treat you the way you deserved, I was insecure and scared to loose you.

One day you had enough, I was crushed, but deep down I knew, it was the best for you and me. I have never forgiven myself for how I treated you and I probably never will. Today of writing this, it's 10 years ago.

If somehow you are able to read this, I want you to know, how much I learned from being with you, I learned what love was supposed to feel like, I learned what it was like to drop everything for another person. Sadly I didn't learn how to treat you, so you'd know what love was supposed to feel like.
